TO T IBULLUS. xxi

to reside upon it: and though he speaks often of his
poverty, it is always os a poverty which is not inconsistent
with competency. Thus in 1.1.19-22 he compares his
present with his former condition:

Vas queque felices quendam nune puerperis agri
Custodes, fertr's munera vestra, Lares:

Tunc vz'tula innumeros lustrabat caesa iuvencos,
Nunc agua exigui est lrestr'a parva seli.

‘Ye, too, my Lares, guardians of an estate once rich,
now poor, receive your gifts3 in those days would a call
be slaughtered to purisy unnurnbered steers, but now for
mytiny farm there falls a little lamb!

And when, at the end of the same poem, he resigns to the
avaricious the hope of bringing back a fortune from the
wass, he adds on his own account:

Ego ceutpesite securus acerve
Despiciam dites despiciamque famem.

‘With pile stored up,l shall know no care: l shall envy
not the rich, l shall fear not hunger.'

Thus his property is reduced, not lost altogether: and
his tone throughout his poems is that of a man who pos-
sesses a modest competence, and whose aisn in life it is to
make the most of the simple pleasures which it could
afford him. But the standard ol wealth at Rome was
high in the days of Tibullus: and that he was stillvery
comfortably off, in spite of his losseS, is plain from the
words of Horace, Ep. 1. 4 7, who says to him

Di tibi divitias dederunt artemque fruendi:

‘The gods have given thee wealth, with the knowledge
how to enjoy it.’ ι
While again in l. 1o he says that he has

Et uerendus victus urm deficiente crumena,

‘A tidy competence, and a purse that lails not.’
