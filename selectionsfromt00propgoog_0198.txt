Greece and stampcd, as it seems to me, with evident marks os high
antiquity represent Ixion, the Phlegyan chiestain, as the srrst example
olan expiation from blood-guiltiness, but withal repaid by ingrati-
tude. Ixion, in slaying the father of his bride, is the first among men
who has shed kindred blood (Pind. Pyth. 2. 32). Then wild srenzy
ttius him; he wanders like Cain ; none either os gods or men will
&Vt him expiation (Pherecyd frag. 69), until Jupiter himself at last
takes compassion upon him and cleanses him. But, unmindsul ol the
sacredobligation which binds the expiated to the expiator, he stretches
f0rth his audacious arms even to Juno‚“ (Mueller.) Dcceived by
kegoddess, who substituted a cloud moulded into her own shape, he
became the father of Centaurus, from whom sprung the monster
tace hall man, half horse. Zeus, to punish his insolent ingratitude,
lttnched his bolt and hurled him down to Erebus, where, bound to an
uu-revolving wheel, he atones for his offence by eternal torments.'

1er children, Apollo and Artemis, by whose shafts the monster was
hin. He endures eternal tortnre in the realms of Hades, where
altura prey upon his liver, Hom. Od. 11. 575, Apollod. 1. 4. 1.

len. 6. 595 has closely imitated the passage in six magnificent lines:
Nec non ct Tityon Terrae omniparentis alumnum,

Porrigitur ; rostroque immanis voltur adunco
