PROPERTIUS, 111. 5., 7-22. 285

end with s ; inferna was changed to infernas, either because rates
had been changed first, or because s follows at the beginning of
stulte ; in was dropped out, as Paley suggests, because it recurs in
instruo ; and lastly, when the omission was discovered, αιί, as the
most likely preposition, was inserted.

rudus. Cp. Job 1. 21 Naked caute Ioui ofmy nrothcr's wouh,
and uuked shall I return thither. So 1 Tim. 6. 7.

15. miscebitur. Misceo here, as usual, means an indiscriminate
mingling, without regard to kind or quantity, in opposition to tempero,
which means ‘to mingle in due proportion.’ Cp. Haec ita mixtu
suerunt ut temerata nullofum'nt modo Cic. Rep. 2. 23. 4²·

16. consule. Jugurtha was captured in the year succeeding
Marius’ first consulship, in nc. 106; but Marius entered the city in
triumph upon the second day of his second consulship, Jan. 2,
rac. 104.

17. The Croesus of Lydia is contrasted with Irus, the greedy
beggar of the Odyssey (18. 5, etc), to represent the extremes of
wealth and poverty.

18. A corrupt line, which no one has succeeded in emending or
interpreting satisfactorily. The MSS. read parta, which is senseless,
or parca. Bae. conjectures carpta, retaining apta before die. Lach.
conjectures parcae, comparing Virg. Aen. 12. 150 Parcarumque dics,
of a natural death; but the singular in this sense is unexampled.
Other conjectures are tarda and (equally good) propera. N. has
apia before dic ; Hertz. and Lach. read acta, comparing 3. 7. 30,
which is scarcely in point. When H. is reduced to interpreting parca
dies as ‘a day which spares the life, i. e. puts off death, as long as
possible,' and Paley as ‘a day, or time, of poverty‚' it is useless to
consult commentators further. If we read, as in the text, actu quac
venitapta die, we at least have sense: ‘That death is best which
comes at its own fit time, when one‘s day is done?

21. fle iuvat reminds us of the refrain Hor. Od. 1. 1. 3 sqq.
Sunt quos. . . iuvat, etc.

celuim and implicuisse 1. 20, alongside of vincire l. 21,
show that no distinction can be drawn between the present and
perfect infinitive. Pers. is fond of the same usage; cp. 2. 66
fs* · WHacc baccam conchae rasisse, astringere uenus.

’ vinctas. The phrase is borrowed from the idea of chaplets:
see next line.

22. eaput habere tn rosa. ‘To have one’s head crowned
with roses,’ i. e. ‘to carouse! So Cic. has in rorupotarc Fin. a. ao.
65 ; Seu. iu rosa iacere Ep. 56. 9.
