Δ PROPERTIUS, IV. 3., 11-21. 333

-where the whole marriage party aiter the oeremony accompanies
the bride to her new home in a procession headed by a fiddler.

14. Nothing was more ill-omened than that the proceedings of '

a marriage should in any way come in contact with the para·
phernalia ofa death or a funeral. See Ov. Met. 6. 429: among the
ill omens of Procne’s marriage,
Eumenides tenuere faces de funere raptas.

During the Feralia no marriage took place, Ov. F ast. a. 559

lamina nigra, not merely ‘dim’ but ‘dark'and ‘funest' in
their boding, because of their having been lighted irem the overtumed
remains ol a funeral pyre. There is perhaps an allusion to the fact
that the marriage torch was made of the wood ol the white thorn.

15. On reaching the door of his own house, the bridegroom pre-
sented the bride with tire and water, as symbols ol the necessaries os
life. Arethusa declares that the water was not letched from a pure
spring, but from some Avemian pool connected with the lower world.

16. The god Hymen or Hymenaeus, invoked throughout the
procession in the marriage song, was supposed to be present
throughout the proceedings.

17. portia. This word implies city gates, not the gates of a
temple. At the city gates there were chapels or shrines to the
Lares Viales, under whose protection travellers were placed. Simi-

ior those venturing on sea-voyages. See note on Tib. r. 1. 20.

pendent apparently refers to tablets hung up with a record of
the vow. See note on 2. 28. 43.

vota are not ‘votive offerings,’ as Paley supposes, which were
not hung up until aster the prayers made had been granted, but
only the promise of such offerings accompanying the prayer.

18. Arethusa is represented as occupying herself at horne with
wearing her husband's military cloak, with the simplicity oi an
early Roman matron. So Lucretia, Ov. Fast. 2. 743, sits and works
among her maidens:

Mittenda est domino, nunc nunc properate, puellae,
Quamprimum nostra facta lacerna manu.

19. vallam, the accusative of vallus, ‘a stalre3’ vallum is a
palisade.

20. per, ‘by means of.' The proposition is rare in this sense,
except with persons: such adverbial phrases as per iocum, per
otium, per viam, etc, are common, but not parallel.

21, 22. An ancient fable is here alluded to, similar to our
proverb oi making ropes ol sarid, and represented in a picture by
