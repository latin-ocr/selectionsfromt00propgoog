32. Cp. Ov. Her. 1. 3¹
Atque aliquis posita monstrat fera praelio numa,
Pingit et exiguo Pergam tota mero:
Hac ibat Simois, hic est Sigeia tellus,
Hic steterat Priami regia celsa scum
Illic Aeacides, illic tendebat Ulixes,
Hic lacer admissos terruit Hector equos.
So also Voltaire‚
Et le vicux nouaclliste, une caune d la maim

35-38. ‘This picture corresponds closely with the acoouuld
the Infemal Regions, to be found m Homer, who representat&
realms of Hades asa gloomy and desolate region, where the spiri!
of the deputed, although not suffering actual pain, are strangam
enjoyment. See Tib. 1. 3. 56!

36. saetae navita turpis uuae. Turpis here mernerunt
‘rough and unkempt! So Virg. uses the word of a horse’s hul·
‘ugly,’ ‘clumsy‚’ Geo. 3. 52; of the scab, ib. 4415 of the lorsuf
looks in old age, ib. 963 of limbs fonled with mud‚ Aen. 5. 353
The best MSS. read puppis: but the words would be readily into·
changed, and puppis was evidently introduced to suit nauita by}
scribe who could not understand turpis. Charon is describodbr
Virgil as horribili squalore Aen. 6. ²99 ; by Propertius as a m
senex 3. 18. ²43 by Juvenal as a partimus teter 3. 265.

37. The reading of A. is percussionne, which makes no good
sense. The words usto capillo show that some word is needed de·
scribing the condition of the cheeks after death, whilst still visible
on the flaming pyre. Strangely enough, the popular ancient belief
was that the shades bore in the infemul regions the same appearance
as nt the moment of death, or even when half consumed by the
dames. ln l'irg. hen. 495 Deiphobus appears with his body ⁸11
rnangled: arrd l‘rop. 4. 5. 7-10 draws his vision of the demand
Cynthia thus.
