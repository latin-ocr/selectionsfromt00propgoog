TO PROPERTIUS. xxxv

known: (Spealr I false? or do I truly touch the region
of thy fatherlandt) where dank Mevania drips with
its sunken plain ς where reek, through summer days, the
waters of the Umbrian mere; where rise the walls on
the top of yon climbing height—walls that bave gathered
name from genius ol thiae? The MS. reading in l. 125
is Asis: but this is almost demonstrably wrong. There
is no such name as Asis. Hertzberg in vain attempts to
show that it was the name of the mountain behind Asisium,
on the slopes of which also lay Hispellum. Hence Lach-
mann conjectures Astii: but it has been shown that the
first syllable of that word is long, not short. There isa
Greek form of the name ’Aleion used by Strabo; and Pro·
pertius might conceivably have used for his verse a form
A isi, genitive of Aisium. But the reading Asis, like Asisi,
has evidently sprung lroma desire to connect the poet with
Asisium, and the position of that town, which is most re·
markable does not suit the words of the line. The modern
town occupies the same site as the ancient town, aud its
peculiarity is that it is not on the top (vertice) of a hill,
but actually forms a shelf on the side of a steep straight
hill, which rises up no less steeply behind it. No
room could be found even for the church of St. Francis,
except by building out arcades as a foundation: so too
with the great convent beside it. It would be quite im·
possible to describe the walls of the town as crowning a
height ¹. Hertzberg suggests that vertice might be an
ablative os the instrument, as though the wall was
actually formed ‘by the top of a hill 3' but this is pre·
cisely what it was not. The words describe some town

¹ What is here said of Assisi is taken from personal obser-
vation. See Murray's Handbook, and the Quarterly Review,

No. 208. Dante, Par. 11. 43, describes the site as hanging from
the mountain side:

Fertilc costa d' alto monte pende.
