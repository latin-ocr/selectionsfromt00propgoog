This poem, together with the one which follows it, is among tlt
most charming and touching ol all the love-poems of Prope-nia
They are poems which none other of the amatory poets of Rome
could have written, and which alone would be enough to give a dis
tinguishing mark to his genius. They are essentially modern in their
character. There is no tinge of coarseness or artificiality, no moe
of the lahoured and pedantie conceits of the Alexandrine school iu
the love which they breathe. The pain and the love which the poti
pours sorth are essentially romantic rather than classical in their
character; and as pure and true to nature as the winds, the waiet
and the rocks which he addresses. The cast of the pleces is eu· '
tire-ly modern: it may he doubted whether lhere are any poemsin
antiquity which come so near to the spirit of the Nature school ol
English poetry. llriven to despair by Cynthia's hardness, he embada
upon n voyage, he buries himself in some lonely spot in the hope ol
driving her image from his mind3 but the first breath of a storm,the
soughing of the trees, and the songs ol birds, only add luel to his
passion: hc eurses the solly which has induced him to tear himself
away lrom her, and every sight and sound only makes him feel the
more that in leaving her he has left lhe whole world behind him.
lle speaks to the wimls with the passion of a Iear, to the trees and
the birds and the streams with the tendemess of a Rosahnd: he
calls on the hecches and the pines to bear witness to his love ; he
curves l'ymliia's name upon their trunl<s‚ he shouts it aloud to the
rocks: he colours all nature with the intensity of his own seelings.
and looks sor her help and sympathy in every phase of his passion.
There is throughout that relined appreciation os the beauties eluatur,
and that sense of their mysterious correspondence with the various
moods ol man's mind, which we are aecustomed to regard as charae·
teristic ol our own modern poets.
