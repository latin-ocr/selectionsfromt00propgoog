enarrarem, 1v. 3, 2-10. 331

:nil¹ of long streaks or trails of flame. So Luc. 10. 256 has langa mitescere

,εῑζ tractu os the long course of the Nile.

7. modo, ‘lately.‘

“Ji · tteratos...per ortua,=‘ior many and many a day past?
‘j' ‘she artus are the risings of the sun·

-··· iteratos means repeated„not ior a second time only, but over
:³ and over again, so that it=aeultos. Palmer quotes Ov. Fast. 6. 199
ἱ ¹ ior Phoebusque iteraverit ortus: but me first part of that line
· ἐ Mane ube' bis suere't shows that a second repetition only is meant.
ἕ Ιιι 4. 1. 82 sigua iterata rotae are the signs of the zodiac, ‘scanned
a· again and again' by astrologers3 and in Stat. Silv. 1. 2. 84 iterata
³' vulnera arewounds‘repeated again and again? Schultze supposes
' Lycotas to be compared to a star ‘rising day aiter day' over Bactra.

’ Β. lauriana. The reading is uncertain: the text is a con·
jeeture oi Jacob, adopted by most editors, for the hericus of the best
MSS. Τὴε Neuri were a Sarmatian tribe mentioned by Val. Flac.
6. 122 et raptor agrorum Neurus, and by other authors, while
the Sarmatians were specialiy noted for their heavy mail-elad horse·

⁸ men. See Tac. Hist. 1'. 79, where the cavalry of another Sarmatian
tribe, the Roxolani, are described. They' were so heavily armed Ἰ
that once fallen, like the knights in the Middle Ages, they could not
rise. Between Β. c. 30 and ao operationshad been undertaken against
the Daci and other tribes beyond the Danube, to which Horace often
refers, and which would make an allusion to any Sarmatian tribe-
as to the Getae in 1. 9-quite natural. The conjecture Sericus is
not improbable. The Seres, of whom the Romans knew little or
nothing, are spoken of in three places by Horace as an extreme
Eastern tribe within reach of the power of Rome, Od. 1. 12. 56,
3. ²9· 27, 4. 15. n3; and it is remarkable that in me parallel poem
to Postumus, Propertius speaks of the Medion (i. e. Parthian) arrows
and the mailed horsemen in one meeth, 3. 12. 11
Neue tua Medae laetentur caede sagittae,
Ferreus aurata ueu cataphractus equa.

10. decolor. There can be little doubt that decoloris the right
reading, rather than the de'sealar of the MSS. The prepositions di and
de are perpetually interchanged in MSS. Munro, Journal of Phil.
vol. 6. p. 62, points out that discolor is read for decolor by an equal
number of MSS. in each oi the six places in Ovid where decolor
occurs. Ovid uses the word specialiy of india and the Indicus:
and Seneca also has Iude'a decolor, Hippolytus 345. Munro holds,
without sufficient reason, that an aqua cannot mean ‘on the
Eustem ware or waters,' as an ablativa oi place· isle mewa ina&
