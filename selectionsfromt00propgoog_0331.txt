that each line contains a single aad separate idea. so that Poegr
argument that flumina, l. 26, ‘showr'two rivers must be mention

garding it as a certain correction. So Palmer. But it is annecersary,r
does not improve the sense. To say that Hector ⁴ thrice through
across the plain stained the charior-wheels of Achilles' is an inte
gible mode of saying that three turns or courses were made thror
the plain, i. e. that he was thrice dragged round the city. But
say that he ‘ thrice stained the plain, thrice the wheels ¹ is less obri
