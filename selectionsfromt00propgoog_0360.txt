PROPERTIUS, 111. 70, 19-22. 293

beloved by Agamemnon, who also methis death by drowning. The
ancient passages in which the legend is mentioned are quoted by
Mr. Ellis, viz, Plut. Gyrilli 7, Athen. 13. 8, Clemens Alex. Protrept.
11. ao, Sylburg., and Steph. Byz. A rgynnus. They all connect Argyn-
nus with the mainland of Greece; in two the Cephissns is named spe-
cially as the river in which he was drowned; in another the Boeotian
lake Copais is named in connection with the incident. As the Cephis-
sus is out of the question here, Mr. Ellis supposes that Propertius
followed some other legend, which connected the drowning of
Argynnus with some point on the coast of Asia Minor. Ont oi
severat names which might be connected with Argynnus, he selects
,the promontory Argennum, exactly opposite to the island of Chios,
and conjectures Mimantis for minantis, showing that in MSS. Mimas
has frequently been corrupted into minas, minax, and similar forms.
Mount ammas is one of the three mountainous projections into
which the peninsula between Teos (S.) and Clazomenae (N.) spreads
γ itself out. Mr. Ellis points out that Agamemnon was specially
honoured near Clazomenae (Pars. 7, 5. 6); and there were probably
Agamemnon legends all along the Ionian coast. Assumiug therefore
that ‘the waters of Mimas' might be used to denote a point on the
shore near to the promontory of Argennum, he proposes to read either
(a) Qum natat Argynni poena, Mimantis aquae,
making aquae in apposition to litora, and translating ‘ Shores sig·
nalised by the punishment of Argynnus, the waters of Mimas which
drowned him :’ or else
(b) Qua natat Argynni poena Mimantis aquas.

He prefers the former reading, as involving a slighter change,
and as being more recondite. The authority of Mr. Ellis will doubt-
less commend this reading to future editors: but I venture, with much
diffidence, to think that there arc strong reasons against it. For (1)
there is no legend that Argynnus was punishaa’ for anything. (a) The
‘waters of Mimas’ is a somewhat strange expressiori to denote a point
on the shore near Mount Mimas. (3) Strictly speaking, the promon-
tory Argennum was not on any part of Mount Mimas at all. It was
on a spur' of Mount Corycus, forming the Westem spur of the three·
pronged peninsula, while Mimas was the Northem. The passage
quoted by R. Ellis from Strabo gives Mimas its true position, be-
tween Erythrae and Hypocremnns. No great weight perhaps need
be attached to this point, for Mimas was apparently the best-known
name of the three, and Propertius may have had in his mind the
words of Odys. 3. 172
