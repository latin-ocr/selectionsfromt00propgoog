PROPERTJUS, 111. 11, ⁷13 111. 18, 1-2. 315

must be taken with stagna 1. 2, as in Cat. 64. 66, where os Ariadne's

clothes, etc,
Omnia quae toto delapso e corpore passim

Ipsieu oute pedes fluetus salis alludebant.

Elsewhere the word is used intransitively, or with a cognate accusative,
as in Virg. Aen. 7.Ι 117 Nee plura alludens Ludere, with the accu-
sative, is only used in the sense ‘to mock‚’ ‘to befool?

ab umbroso may mean either ‘on the side of: ‘coming from,’
or ‘away from,’ i. e. ‘shut off from! Postgate supports the latter
interpretation by insula ea sinum ab alto claudit Liv. 30. 24. 9,
which is different, as the island is said quite naturally to ‘shut off ' a
hay from the open sea. Strictly parallel is Virg. Aen. 1. 160

insula portum

Efficit olo'ectu laterum, quibus omnis ab alto

Frangitur inque siuns scindit sese unda reductos.
Here the water itself frangitur al alto, which seems to mean ‘is
broken as it rolls inirom the sea’ The Julian Harlour was the great
work of Agrippa, constructed in Β, e. 37 with a view to carrying on
the naval war with Sextus Pompeius, whose fleet had its head-quarters
opposite in Sicily. The dark and mysterious Lacus Avemus—the
haunt of the Cumaean Sibyl-was separated bya mile of land from
the Lucrinus Lucus—famous for oysters—and this again was partly ’
protected from the outer sea by a narrow reef of rock called oia Her-
culis, because laid down by Hercules to spare himself the trouble of
going round the bay. Agrippa dug a canal between the two lakes,
and strengthened the oia Herculis into an efficient breakwater, leav-
ing a passage sor ships to enter.

pontus is the outer sea, which now alludit, i. e. washes up
through the contiuuous channel to the quiet waters of the lake within.
Virg. Geo. a. 161, thus alludes to this great work:

Au memorem portus, Lucrinoque addita claustra,
Atque indignatum maguis stridoribus aequor,
Iulio qua ponto longe sonat uieda refuso,
lyrrlrenusque fretis immittitur aestus Auernis?

Pinder explains the MS. reading ludit ‘oi the quiet sportive
motion of waters protected from winds‘ But the sea was not calm
because shut out srom Avernus.

2. To make stagna, etc. in appositiou to pontus is harsh in the
extreme, and unmeaning. Baiae was situated quite outside the Julian
harbour, and at some distance from it, on the western shore of the
Baianus Sinus. It is clear, however, that fumida stagna refers to
the Lucrine lake. The whole region is volcanic: andfumido refers
