17. inritum cp. agitur in the exactly parallel passage, a. 1. 71
Quandocumque agitur vitam mea fata reposcent.

'n both passages a contemplation of his death is made to follow, as

y a natural consequence, upon au emphatic protestation of his love.

18. acta, ‘the arrangements’ or ‘dispositions' for his funeral.

‚⁸hey are called acta, because made, decided upon, during his life. ²¹

'ostgate well compares the phrase acta Caesan’s, which occurs so

u the grave—for the very good reason that he had no claim to such
distinction. All nobiles, i. e. descendants of men who had held

rallred before the bier in long procession to the place of buming or

re most grotesque and yet impressive sights ever witnessed. There
assed forth, says the historian, ‘in long array all the fathers of the
nlian house—Aeneas, all the Alban kings, then the Sabine nobility
ith Attus Clausus, and all the rest of the Claudii,' Ann. 4. 9. See
