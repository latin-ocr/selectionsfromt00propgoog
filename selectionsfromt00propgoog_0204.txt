9. We thus see that Tibullus accompanied Messalla in the
campaign. The Tarbelli are named by Plin. N. H. 4. 19 amongst the
Aquitaniantribes. Their country, id. 30, 2, was celebrated forits
hot and cold springs. They lived on the Aturus, and are men·
tioned by Lucan aud other authors as living on that stream,

1. 4¹9 nunc rura ltfemosi
Qui tenet, et repas Aturi, qua litore curva
Molliter admissum claudit Tarbellicus aequor,
Signa mouet, gaudetque amoto Santonus basta.

Amnius speaks ol Tarbellicus Aturus, and the tribe has given its
name to the modern Tarbcs. “
10. The Santones dwelt to the N. of the Garonne, giving their
nmue to the modern province Santoigne. ’
Ι 11. Arar. The Arar is the modern Saone, a river which flows
¹¹1l0 the Rhone with a course due Southwards at Lyons, and has its
origin on the S. slopes of the Vosges mountains, not far irom the
²¹ buces ol the Meuse und the Moselle‚ which, rising on the Northern
ude oi the same chain, flow N orthwards towards the Rhine and the
Atlntie. Geographically speaking, the valley of the Saone is, in
her, the continuation, or rather the commencement, of the great
Rhone valley, so that the Rhone ought rather to be considered the
tributary os the Saone. than the Saone the tributary ol the Rhone.
Bit with rivers, as with nations‚ might osten triumphs over right:
and the superior volume oi the Rhone, sed by the snows os Switzer-
linibus enabled it to usurp the title which belonged by right to the
pheid Gallio stream. Caesar thus describes the Saone: Flumen
‘³2 Arar, quod perfines Aeduorum ct Sequanorum in Rhodanum
stult incredibili lenitate, ita nt oculis, in utram partem fluat, iudi-
Μή non possit B. G. 1. 12. ἱ Ι
· 12. cunnus. So M.: but A. has Carnote‘. Caesar calls the
le⁰ple Carnutes: but as the Greek lorm is Καρνοῦτοι, the Latin
·s0rn should be Carnutes, not as here Carnutis. This people
heresars time occupied the country to the W. of the upper selue,

Ι upon both banks oi the Loire. They give their name to the province
alled Chartrain, and to the modern town of Cbartrcs (Autricum).
lt is to be noted that in this and other cases, the name oi modern
French towns is derived not from the Roman name of the ancient
city on the same site, but srom that os the Gallio tribe which
occupied the surrounding country. Thus Paris derives its name from
the Parisii, not irom Lutetia ; Bourgcs from the Bituriges, not
hon Aoarr'cum; Tbnrs, not from Augustodunum, but imm uie
