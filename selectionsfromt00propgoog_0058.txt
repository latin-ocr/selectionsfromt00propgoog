TO PROPERTIUS. li

who has himself carefully examined the MS. in question.
This MS. is now in the ducal library at Wolfenbiittel:
it is called Neapolitanus (or N. throughout this edition)
because it was inspected at Naples by N. Heinsius,
and from the fact that the name Manetti is written in
faint letters on its last page, it seems to have once been
the property ol a scholar of that name who died at

Naples in the year 1459. The MS. ison parchment, os
large octavo size; it is composed of seventy·one leaves,
aud contains no writing but Propertius. At the beginning
are the usual words Inczssit Propertius: at the end Ex-
plicit. Books I and ll are not separated: there is
an interval between lll and IV. There is no title, nor
space left for a title, ‘at the beginning ol the different .

poems: but the initial word of each is marked by an
illuminated letter. A good many oi the leaves are
damaged3 one leaf, containing 4. 11. 17-76, has been lost
altogether3 and three different pens or hands can be
recognised as having been employed in the transcription.
The history of the MS. is not known. Lachmann,
followed by Hertzberg, assigned it to the thirteenth cen-
tury: L. Mueller puts it at the fourteenth, or more
probably the fifteenth‚ while Baehrens declares it cannot
be older than 1430. All agree that the writing presents
certain characteristics of an earlier date than this3 but
Baehrens explains these away by supposing that the MS.
was written in Italy, and that certain archaisms of writing
lingered on in that country after they had been exploded
elsewhere. M. Plessis has caresully examined the MS.
anew3 and backed by the authority of two other F rench
palaeographists—M. Leopold Delisle and M. Chatelain—
he declares positively that it cannot be assigned to a later
date than the beginning of the thirteenth century. This
conclusion he iounds upon six distinct peculiarities in the
handwriting, the concurrence of which, he asserts, per·
