362 NOTES.

Prop. 3. 19. 22, where Scylla, who caused her father’s death and
ruin (as Delilah Samson’s) by cutting off a lock of hair, is de-
scribedas

Tendens purpurei? regna paterna coma.

39. Persen. The name of Perseus naturally suggests that of
his conqueror, and is used here for it.

These two lines have been much canvassed. They contain a
reference to L. Aemilius Paullus Macedonicus, the conqueror of Per-
seus: by an inversion characteristic of Propertius, he makes Cornelia
appeal first to Perseus himself (l. 39), whose name suggests naturally
that of Paullus; then'in l. 40, addressing Perseus, he specifically de-
scribes his conqueror. ‘lappeal to Perseus too, him that boasted
all the bravery of his ancestor Achilles: and him too who broke
down thy house, Perseus, for all thy boasts in thine ancestor
Achilles’ The repetition of Achilles is strongly ironical: Perseus
and other members of the Macedonian house were for ever boasting
of their descent from him, aeternus carmine Achilles Sil. Ital.
14. 95. Another explanation is to make Persen governed by fregrt:
‘him who broke Perseus, and thy house Pers us,' but this is harsh
and gives less excuse for the tuas. Icannot follow Mr. Postgate.
Because Silius Italicus has the word stimules in one passage
(14. 93) in connection with Pyrrhus’ boasting in his ancestor
Achilles, and stimulabat in another (3. 609) quite unconnected with
Achilles; because in a third (15. 292) proava tumebat Achille is
said of Philip; and in a fourth (3. 246) vano corda tuueore is applied
to a man proud of being Hannibal's nephew: therefore he holds it
clear that Silius Italicus had this passage of Propertius before him,
’ and that temu'das (or cognate word) and stimulantem were read in the
copy which he followed. In these passages the words stimulos
turture, etc. occur in a perfectly natural way, and Silius had no need
to be guided to their use. But Postgate is entirely right in rejecting
the rash changes proposed by H. A. J. Munro, Journal of Philo·
logy, 6. pp. 53-62, and in condemning his sweepingdictum that ‘the
Latin language percmptorily forbids that simulantem can mean “who
formerly affected.'’' The use of the present participle is merely an
extension of the use of the present for the past tense noticed on 3. 7.
aa. Cp. Virg. Aen. 9. 266 quem dat Sidonia Dido. Simulantem
gives an abiding characteristic of the man, almost equivalent to
simulatorem, ‘the pretender to.’ Cp. also tondens 5. 19. 22, fugiens
4. 6. 15, and the present nutrit 4. 4. 54. A still closer parallel is
Tac. Ann. 1-13 (quoted above), where Augustus describes M.
Lepidus as being capacem sed aspernantem.
