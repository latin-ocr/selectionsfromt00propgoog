properarat, 111. 7, 23-28· 295

Propertius is of mythological allusious, he introduces them always
appropriately, so as to heighteu, not to interrupt, the feeling ofa
passage3 this couplet, if genuine, would be almost a solitary in·
stance in Propertius of lines dragged in inappropriately, for the mere
purpose of parading learning, and that in a passage of strong feel·
ing where the blemish is all the more apparent. To enter into geo·
graphical details, to drag in Iphigenia, and the Greek fleet, and
Aulis, painfully interrupts the feeling of the passage, which iscon-
centrated on Paetus and the mode of his death. And the legend
knows of no connection between any youth and the delay of the
Greek fleet. Further, as Mr. Postgate points out, it is clear that
these lines refer to the usual version of the tradition, according to
which Argynnus was drowned in the Cephissus. To connect the
delay at Aulis witha drovming near Mount Mimas is more than
awkward—it is absurd. Mr. Ellis himself doubts the genuineness
of these lines, and while offering the following paraphrase, acknow·
ledges that the connection is awkwardly indicated: ‘Paetus was
wrecked on· the coast, which retains the name of the lost Argynnus‚
that youth whom Agamemnon vainly sought to discover, and kept
the fleet at Aulis waiting in the hope of doing so-a delay which
caused the death of Iphigenia! Cau any one believe Propertius
capable of such an irrelevant and pedantic train of thought iu the
middle of such a poem as this?

25. Reddite, a vague address to the powers, whoever they are,
who control the fate of Paetus’ body. Possibly Aquilo and Neptune
(11. 13, 15) are included. Reddo (see note on a. 1. 71) implies not
restoration, but a giving of what is due, natural, or expected. All
kinds of duty therefore are appropriate to the word: here the notion
is that a body is due to the earth, as much as that it is the duty of
friends to bury it. Professor Jebb suggests to me that the words
Reddite, etc. give the key to the whole passage, and that the
word litora l. 21, with the allusion to the legend of Argynnus, is
introduced to add point to the prayer of l. r 5, that Paetus’ body
may at least be buried. ‘There is a shore near—the shore where
Argynuus was drowned—O waft the body of Paetus to that shore l’

posita est. So N.: much more pointed than H.’s positaque.
As Jacob puts it, ‘Praedam habetis .· corpus reddite!

26. sponte tua, i. e. as we, his friends, are helpless.

vilis, as though he were addressing the nauta of 1. 27, not
the sand itself. So Hor. Od. 1. 28. 23.

27. τωιιὶωτ, as in a. 7. 9‚= praeteribit.

28. timor, as in l. 13, for timori. .
