renueras, 1. 3, 13-18. 123

, respiceret. Respicere, iit. ‘ to look back,' is coustantly used os

“ that repeated, respectful, or loving looking, to which we give the
name oi ‘ regard’ Here it means ‘to regard with sear and anxiety,'
and though the use ol aias as an object is remarkable, there is no
reason to adopt the inferior MS. reading respueret, or Haupt's conj.
despuerat, in reference to the well-known ancient superstition (still
shared apparently by so many of our countrymen) that spitting
brings good luck.

many passages in the writers oi the Augustan age, and their imme-
diate successors, which prove that, scomed as the Jews were who
had migrated to Rome, some of their peculiar tenets were well
known and respected, by the vulgar at least. Thus Ov. A. A. 1. 41 5
