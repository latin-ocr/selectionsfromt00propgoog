280 NOTES.

Rome as a province. Thus veniet is stronger thanfiet, as if the Esst
came voluntarily to place herself under Roman protectior. rie '¹
same idea is implied in fluent. '

5. vlam, in allusion to the fasces. It may be a dativesf ·
possession, or possibly an ablative of description. ·

6. sartha for Parthica: see note on 3. s. 11.

7. prosse is the vocative: so equi in the next line.

expertas bello, in allusion to Augustus’ naval victoda:
srrst, that gained over Sextus Pompeius by Agrippa in Sicily nc. 3⁶,
and, more notably, the battle ofActium in B. c. 31.

dats lintea, ‘spread your sails' Dare is frequently thus
used with an accusative in such away that the phrase is equivalent to
an intransitive verb. Thus Lucr. a. 1¹43 says that one day the
walls of the world

Expugrsata dabunt labem putrisque ruinas,
which simply means, ‘will fall in crumbling ruins.' So dat
sonitum, properly ‘causes a sound,’ is equivalent to ‘ resounds? se
Munro on Lucr. l. c. In other passages dare with a predicatirc
adjective is equivalent to a transitive verb: as Virg. Aen. 9. 3²3
Haec ego vasta dabo.

8. ducite munus. It is quite out of place to refer rhea
words to the Equites equo publico or the Equitum recognitio,
a ceremony long disused with a view to actual warfare, and only
partially restored for mere form's sake (Suet. Oct. 38) by Augusta
The phrase is a confused expression ς ducere is appropriate to hom»
‘lead forth,‘ or ‘ draw ;‘ munus, ‘function,' would imply some such
word as ‘perform’ before it. As it stands, therefore, the phrase will
cover any work to be done by horses: armigeri confines it to the
cavalry.

9. plats, ‘avenge’ Piarc is a transitive verb, used in the
widest possible sense to denote any act of religious duty in rt·
ference to the thing or person which stands as its object. ΟΜ
god, ‘to appease' or ‘worship' as Hor. Ep. 2. 1. 143 Silvanum
lacte piabant ; of an altar, Prop. 3.10. 19 ubi turc piaveris arat.
‘hast duly honoured;’ of a bad omen, ‘to avert its evil con·
sequences,’ Virg. Aen. 2. 1845 of a crime, ‘to expiate it,¹ ‘wipe it
out,' ib. 140. Here the idea is ‘to avengez’ ‘wipe out the impiety
of leaving the Crassi and their slaughter unavenged.'

11. lumina. Rarely used, as here, of a fire.

12. ssis, correctly, of a distant, uncertain day: elsewhere, as wc
have seen, Propertius uses hic in the same sense.

13. oneratos axes, the reading oi the hlbb.,isperluapsbetter
