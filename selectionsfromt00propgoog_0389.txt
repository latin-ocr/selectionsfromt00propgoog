322 NOTES.

Nor can we help recalling the story in the Arabian nghts ol bt
king who vainly shut up his son in a tower of brass to savehin
from his predicted fate.

27. linea: alluding to Hom. Il. a. 673

Νιρεὺς ds κάλλιστος ἀνὴρ ὑπὸ Ἴλιον ἦλθεν.
Cp. Ov. E. P. 4. 13· 15 ,
Tam mala Thersiten prohibebat sorma' latere,
Quam pulchra Nireus conspiciendus erat.

29. hio luctus, i. e. distress arising from this same Deatlt, ia

Death itsels.
² 30. Atridae, the dative, not the genitive. See the passages
quoted above, l. 15.

alter amor,hissecoud love. His wifeclytemnestra, was histrst

31. If the MS. reading troicis is right, then Bae. is probably
right in supposing that some lines have dropped out here. Paley's
conjecture traicit, adopted by Palmer, gives good sense, though rte
emphasis of the line makes it hard to believe that tibi and nauta
refer to different persons. Traicr't will bear its transitive meaning,
‘who causes to pass over’ or ‘ferries across?

32. animae corpus inane tuae may be either ‘the body
empty of thy spirit,' as Ov. Met. 2. 611

Corpus inane animae frigus letale secuta est, ,
or, ‘the empty body of thy spirit,' i. e. ‘consisting os thy spirit,' as i
though body and spirit were confused into one idea.

Palmer reads lrac, to correspoud with qua l. 33: ‘by this same
road by which?

33. Siculae victor, referring to the celebrated anoestor oi
Marcellus, M. Claudius Marcellus, who conducted the great siege ol
Syracuse in the second Punic War, nc. 212. Archimedes con·
ducted the delente of the city, and was slaiu upon its capture.

Postgate observes that here, as in 5. 7. 55, Propertius supposes
there were two boats. This is somewhat inconsistent withpublr'ca
cymba l. 24, and is not absolutely necessary, as we may imagine
Charon landing part of his freight at one point, part at another.

34. ab humana vta. These words are difficolt. They seem
to support the reading hac l. 32 and the MS. reading tuac. ‘May
Charon carry thy spirit along that path by which Claudius end
Caesar rose to the stars srom the path ol men? We have already
noted the vague way in which Propertius uses the word vale: see 1. a.
12, 2. 2 5. 46. Postgate well translates ‘ the ways ' or ‘haunts ol ment'
probably Propertius was scarcely conseious that he was using the
word in a double sense.
