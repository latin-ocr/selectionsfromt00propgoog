the impossibility of tearing himself away from it as an
excuse for declining the invitation of Maecenas to occupy
himself with graver themes As the book proceeds, the
poet is still spell-bound by the fascinations of Cynthia,
and there are some poems in the old exuberant key ε but
he speaks more frequently of her inconstancy and ingrati·

forward io a death brought about by her cruelty, and
seems to struggle more resolutely against the slavery
which enthralls him.

By degrees he tums his attention to other subjects;
declares he must now have done with love and sing of
Caesar, and though he shows little alacrity to fulfil the
promise, it is clear that Cynthia has a less exclusive hold
on his regard than during the period covered by the first
book. The poems are os various dateS, and written in
various moods: the twenty-eighth was written as early
as Β. c. 28: the first and tenth were probably written in
ne. 25 or 24.

In the Third Book, only thirteen out of twenty-five
poems refer to Cynthia. In it are included some of
his noblest and most touching poems—amongst these
the eighteenth, written on the occasion os the death of
Marcellus in Β. c. 23, and the exquisitely pathetic seventh,
on the drowning of Paetus—which prove conclusively that
Cynthia was by no means the only, or the noblest,
inspirer of his muse. It concludes with the bitter and
taunting poems in which he abjures his love for her,
and finally casts her off.

The Fourth Book differs materially from all the rest.
