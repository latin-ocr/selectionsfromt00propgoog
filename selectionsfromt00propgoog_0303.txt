236 NOTES.

Hic bellum lacrimosam, hic miseram famem

ltstemque a populo et principe Caesare in
Persas atque Britannos

Vestra neotus aget prece.

indefinite, hut that the indicative subtrahit shows that a particultr

se subtrahit. Our proud insular isolation has perhaps nera
been more simply and finely expressed.

19. Haeo cantassemus, ie. ‘thisis the cause tovrhichl
shall attach my self as a poet,' referring to bella canam l. 8. Hevlll

Resque dome gestas et mea bella cano.

we should say ‘of a tall statue! For this use 01 in, used to localise

22. hio, further defined by ante pedes: ‘just here, before my
fect‚’ as though he were pointing to the very spot So 1. 19. 1.
quoted by Postgate, where illic is explained by caecis lecti.

23. inopes conscendore. Another instance of Horace't
favourite Graecism. Conscendere carmen laudz's, ‘To climb up 10
the height of 1 song of praise' is an intelligible and graphio ex-
pression, expressiug both the difficulty of the task in itself, and the
grandeur 01 the merit that calls for such an effort. It is scarcely
necessary to assume that laudis means ‘thy merit' in particulut
or that there is 1 frigid reference to the stock phrase of climbing
the hill of the Muses.

24. The figure is slightly changed here; instead of cruming
1 statue in honour of a victory, the poet represents himself as
offering a humble offering at the festival of a god. The idea of
vilia tura is exactly illustrated by Horace in his beautiful address
