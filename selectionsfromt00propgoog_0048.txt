seventeenth year. We may thus suppose that he was
born not earlier than Β. c. 50, nor later than uc„ 47, and
that he assumed the manly gown between the years B.c.
34 and 30.

In the first flush of youth, Propertius came across his -
‘sate in the person of the famous Cynthia, at once his
inspiration and his bane. The main work of his life was
to record in passionate poetry the various phases os this
attachment : and the ups and downs in his relations with
her arethe chief landmarks in his biography. Out os the
total number of ninety-one poems which he has lelt behind
him, no less than sixty have relation to Cynthia: if we

can arrange these in chronological order, we have prac- .

tically the story ol his lile. The latest of th'e number are
the two last elegies of Book Ill, in which, with a hardness
and cruelty of tone almost amounting to brutality, he
renounces his love sor her, and finally bids her adieu. ln
the third'line of poem 2 5, summing up the past, he says

Quinque tibi potui servire fideliter annos.

‘For five years 1 was able to serve thee faithfully!

The natural meaning ol these words is that his whole
attachment for Cynthia had lasted for five years: and
though it is possible, as Mr. Postgate thinks, that a tempo·
raryreconciliation may have taken place after these words
were written, it is certain that these two elegies are the
last of'which she was the theme. But before the final
rupture, there was a previous period os estrangement which,
occurred in consequence of some quarrel between, the
lovers, the cause ol which does not appear. Propertius puts
it thus, 3. 16.9

Peccaram semel, et totum sum pulsus in annum,

. ‘Once hadI sinned, and I was driven forth for an entire

l
yeiidre had thus committed some fault, and she punished
him by banishing him from her presence for a year.
Now is this year to be counted amongst the live years
