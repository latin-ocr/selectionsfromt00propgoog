29⁶ noras

29. lutense feeling is shown by the abrupt way in which thr
poet addresses one aster another the persons or things which hare
contributed to the death of Paetus, without taking time to retiae
what they are. Cp. l. 253 here the builders of ships are apostrophised¹

N. has curvae, mistaking rates for a vocative. Cumara isthe
elever but nnnecessary conjecture of Mr. Peskett and Mr. G. T. La
drum. It is much more forcible to identify the curvas rates with
the causas leti. The following line is the commentary.

30. eota, ‘of impelling ships. Propertius means that thoe
who go to sea are nowers in Death‘s vessel' Postgate. This surely
is to introduce unnecessarily a foreign idea. The words merny
imply that those who make ships make occasions for death2a
death like that of Paetus is brought on, caused, by human handu
acta, apparently in the widest sense, after the analogy of agen
uitam, agere otia, agero opus (3. 5. 8), etc„ The harshness of the
phrase is mitigated by the fact that the death was a violent one-
‘brought on,' almost ‘inflicted’ by the hand of man.

31. meast. Looking back to the time when this new chaum
for death had been devised. ¹

fatie, of a natural death, like Fortunae uias in the next line.
Fortunae miseras vias is generally taken, as by Pinder, ‘Chance ways
that lead to misery! But in fact fortunae uias is exactly--ranta‘t
iter; miseras is an ‘epitheton ornans.' ‘The hapless ways of
Fortune¹ is equivalcnt to ‘the many sad forms or modes of death'
See notes on nrortis iter sup. l. a, and animi uia 3. 5. 10.

33. For teneat, tenuere, cp. 2. 10. 14. Propertius was pro
bably not conscious that he was using the word in slightly different
senses. He uses common words like tnnre, agere, via, withgreat
width of meaning.

34. austeri-a. Pindertranslates,‘Eanuman’sproperelement'
as though the lunguage was that of a hen seeing her duckling broad
take to the water. Sua terra is obviously to be explained by
Penates, l. 33, of his native country. Postgate quotes Ov. Am. a. 11.
30, which is exactly in point.

35. paras. See note on 3. 5. 6. Tne word is here used oi
ship-building, :facin aedeficas.

36. consenuit, the aoristic perfect, to denote frequency or
habit. Postgate well quotes Cat. 4. ·a 5 nunc recondita Senot qur‘atr.

fallit . . . fidem, ‘breaks its word,' the opposite offidem servat?
or praestare. The idea is the same as thatin u. 25? 24

Cum saepe in portu fracta cariata natet.
