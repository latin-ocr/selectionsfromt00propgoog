or labour'on the early legends of Rome or Italy. The
question is not without interest: ior by relegating to the
poet’s earlier days all the poems in Book IV which

Ingenium nobis ipse perdefecit,

‘my love herself is the maker of my Muse‚’ and to
bestow on Cynthia the glory os having been the main,
if not the only, inspirer of his genius. Mr. Postgate
says, ‘Without the stimulus of his love, and without the
sympathy and encouragement of his beloved‚ his genius
might never have broken the crust of lethargy which
covered it . . . . With the extinction of his love decayed
his poetic activity. . . . ‘⁴ His Muse‚'' as Hertzberg says,
‘⁴ sank to silence with his love.''' 'There is no doubt that
Cynthia's literary taste¹ did much to stimulate the poet's Ι
genius, aud to throw his love ior her into the imperish·

he calls her decta, the characteristic epithet of poets in 1. 7. 11,
13. 11 and in a moment of anger declares, 2. 11. 5-6

Et tua transibit centemnens essa viatw,
Nec dicet, Cirris liic decta puella suit,

as though her title to ‘learning’ would naturallybe acknowledged

&y ireryone. In 2. 1. ²7·5² he declares the causes of his love
or er:

Quum tibi praesertim Phoebus sua carmina donet,
Aoniamque libens Calliopea lyram;

Unica nec desit iucundis gratia verbis,
Omnia quaeque Venus quaeque Μίκωνα prebat.

His tu semper eris nostrae gratissima vitae,
Taedia dum miserae sint tibi lumriae.
