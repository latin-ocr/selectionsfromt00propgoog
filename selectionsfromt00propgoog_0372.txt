17. All the MSS. read empnere which involves a hiatus, and a
rortening of the last syllable. Virgil and other poets have this
oense not unfrequently, as E. 8. 108, iu the first thesis of a dactyl,

rut, as Palmer points out, it is very rare in the last syllable of a
actyl (see Virg. E. 3. 79 vlle· vlle inquit, and Aen. 3. 211 Insulhe
wie), and it is unknown to Propertius ; so he most 'ingeniouslycon
ectures Iardanis, ‘daughter of Jardanus,'a name by which Omphale
s designated by Ovid, Her. 9. 103. He points out that in no less than
tn instances Propertius designares female characters by their patro-
ymics; thus Helen is called Tyndaris, Penelope Icam'otz's, Niobe
''antalis⁵ and so on. Omphale would thus be a natural gloss, im-
oned into the text. Further he points out that the scribe who
npied Omphale into N. had a rage‘for lengtheuing syllables in
roper names, and probably intended Omphlle to be scanned Om-
hele. The same hand has elsewhere Antrlechi for Antlllchs' a. 13.
