year, but the more pathetic one that he had just reached his twentieth
year, and had a whole life of hope before him, at the moment of
his death. The passages quoted by Postgate do not bear out his
meaning: ⁴ to stand motionless‚' not ‘to come to au end,' is the
meaning of stare in stent aere venti Prop. 3. 10. 5, stabant adolescentes
Lis. The meaning is rather analogous to that oi 'standing firm‚’ ol
asolid work, as ut praeter spem stare muros viderunt Liv. 38. 5 ; or
oi a completed work, as Ov. Met. 11. 205

Aedificant muros, pacta pro cccaenc'bus auro:

Stabat opas ;
or of an enduring work, as iu the common phrase stante republica;
or of a successful work, as Hor. Epp. 2, 1. 176

Securus cadat an recto rtet fabula talo.
Still more wide of the mark is the alternative that steterat means
‘to sall: supported by Prop. a. 8. 10

Et Thebae steterunt, altaque T raia fuit,

where the meaning is surely the opposite: ‘Thebes lras stood,

Troy has beeu,' ie. ‘stands no more, z's no more’ The phrase magno

stare pretio, etc, ‘to stand one iu,’ ‘to cost,’ seems to carry the same
meaning: see below, l. 30, and Virg. Aen. 10. 494

laad illi stabunt Aeneia parvo

Hospltla,
or Ov. Fast, a. 810

Heu quanto regnis nox stetit una tuis!
The event accomplished, the article secured, ‘stand firm,’ ‘are
maintained: ata certain cost, i. e. ‘cost so much’ Here the twentieth
year of Marcellus ‘had stood its ground) ‘had taken up its position
as an accomplished faet‚' ‘had been completed’ Thus the pluperiect
has i'ts full natural force.

Ut pueris placeas et declamatio fiasl
i.e. ‘Go forth theu, is you still admire Hannibal, and,' etc. Post·
gate gives a good parallel, Ov. Her. 9. 105.
