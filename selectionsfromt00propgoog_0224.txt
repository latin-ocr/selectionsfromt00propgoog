rnsuirus 1.10.,68-11. 1. 157 “J

Cui tu lacte favas ei miti dilue Baccha,

Terque navas circum felix eat liastr'a fruges,

Omnis quam charus et sarii comitentur evantes,

Et Cererem clamare uacent in tecta ; neque ante

Falcem matures quisquam supponat aristis,

Quam Cereri, tarta redimitus tempora quercu,

Det matus incompositas et carmina dieat.
Cato (R. R. 141) gives, at length, the form of prayer most fitting
ior such occasions.

‘Resides the Ambarvalia, celebrated by private individuals or small

τ’. communities, there was a public festival, whose name and object were
ι the same, in which the sacred rites were performed bya college of
priests, denominated the Fratres Arvales. These, according to
tradition, were first instituted by Romulus, and, originally, it was their
duty to march in solemn procession round the boundaries of the
sate accompanied by the victims-a boar, a ram, and a buil-con-
“ stituting the sacrifice called Suanetaurilza, singing hymns as they
praed along. When, in later times, from the extension of territory,
this bacam impossible, the sacrifices were still offered at certain
, spots which marked the original limits of the Roman domain¹.'

The only clue as to the date is given in l. 33, in which Messalla’s
Aquitanian triumph is alluded to. The poem must therefore have
been composed after that event, not earlier than the spring os
Β· C. 26. The interest of the piece is great, as it is not a mere theo·
relicui description, but an account of the ceremony which he was him-
Sellabant to celebrate on his own farm, as an act of regular worship.

Ι The shortness os the Second Book os Tibullus’ Elegies has been
spumea by the supposition that the poems contained in it were
'y'ffillected famil pryblispep pfter lipis deaththOvirll, howevei} ιιιςιιιεῖῖὶέανεί

j Tibullus, and some time before he wrote A. A. 3. 535
l( Nos facimus placitae late praeconia formae: '.
Nomen habet Nemesis, Cynthia namen habet.

l. A. and most MSS. have ualeat: but faueat is a certain
correction. Tibullus uses the regular formula with which a sacrifice
⁰1anyholy rite was opened, as linguisque animisque favete Ov.
Met· 15. 677: Ill-omened words must be avoided on such oc·
misum and as the only mode of securing that no ill-omened words
sh⁰11ldbe pronounoed was that no words should be uttered at all,
ihs phrase favete linguis is equivalent to ‘keep silence!
