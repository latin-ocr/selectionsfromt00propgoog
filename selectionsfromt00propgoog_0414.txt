PROPERTJUS,1v. 4., 70—943 IV. 6., 1-4. 347

thrown down in cruel irony to form a nuptial couchi Otherwise
Tatius merely goes through the mockery of acknowledging her as
his wife, and then at once causes her to be put to death.

92. The commentary of the poet. virgo, because she had
broken her vows as a vestal; 0001, in reference to the time when
the pact was made.

94. The only explanation offered of this line is that itis
addressed to Tarpeius, who was vigil or guardian of the gate‚ aud
who received the honour of having the hill called after him asa
reward of his iniusta sors, i. e. in finding the gate betrayed, in spite
of his own loyalty, by his daughter.

IV. 6.

Tms poem 10 0 paean over the great victory of Augustus 01
Actium, like the ninth Epode of Horace. It has not, however, the
merit of having been written at the time; it was not composed till
B. c. 16, on the occasion of the third celebration, under Agrippa, of
the Indi quinquennales ou the Palatina games instituted by a
decree of the Comitia in Β. c. 28 in perpetual commemoration of the
victory. They are not to be confounded with the similar games,
also quinquennales, instituted on the spot itself by Augustus imme·
diately after the victory.

l. Once more the poet assumes the character of a priest about
to perform a sacrifice. The first ten lines contain the exordium
worked out with more than usual elaboration. The description of
the battle itself takes the form of a solemn hymn in honour of the
Palatine Apollo, to whom the victory was due; and the piece ends
withan invitation to sacrificial revelry, as in Horace’s Epode. The
exordium and the hymn that follows are connected in exactly the
same way as iu Hor. Od. 3. 1: see note on Prop. 3. 1.

3. 0000, though not wholly satisfactory, is better than any other
reading proposed: though in sense, Paley’s hadra, if possible, would
do well enough. All through the exordium Propertius mingles
the poetic with the sacrificial terms ; and in l. 3 certet, followed by
corymbis, requires that its subject should relate to song. Thus ara
(Haupt) will not do; serta may be right, as it contrasts best with
corymbis, and Propertius uses the feminine form, 2. 33. 37. Cera
must mean the waxen tablet on which the song was written.
