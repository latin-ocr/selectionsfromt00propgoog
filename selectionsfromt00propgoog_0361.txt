294 NOTES.

(ρ There is nothing in the words, of themselves, to show theno
pertius meunt here to identify the spot where the shipwreok tori
ploce. The Carpathinn Seu ismentioned in l. 12, end no doubtth
shipwreck took place in that see. Now the Carpathiae Seio
round the island of Carpathus, between Crete and Rhodert nd
though the Carpathinn See wesen the wey to Egypt, Mouet nim
was quite away from that course, nearly 150 miles to the northolt
Mr. Ellis gives various quotations as to the Carpathinn See, but nur
of them prove that the Carpathien Sea extended up the Ionian oete
(5) The natural meaning of the words is, ‘Tbere is a shore tootbrl
testifies of Agamemnon’s grief, where Argynnus was drowned.’ tn
point of the illustmtion is not the plaoe where the drowning bt&
place, but the fact that a loved youth was drowned on some mutet
Paetus was drowned. I take therefore the nam of Ρ, eudred
Argynnus for Argynni. Qua natat is us near the reading of ΝΟ

used in place of the perfect (as referring to Argynnus) after the
mormer of Propertius (see note on 4. 4. 54), partly to eonvey the
sense thot Paetus is still at the mercy of the waves. To Atym
the word poena is applied in much the same sense as in 2. no. 31
Atque inter Tityi volucres mea poeria vagatur,
where poena mea means ‘my doomed spirit) Here, as appliedu
Argynnus, it will mean ‘the doom,’ almost ‘the thing punished'
‘the vietim,' of the threatening water.

Lastly, the words sunt litore may be used to indioete e φᾶ
known, but not further named. The translation will then be, ‘Thereit
ashore which tells of Agamemnon’s grief, where floets Argymusrietin
of the angry waters’ Thus the attention is never turned away from thr
piteous case of Paetus: every word in 1. nn applies literally to nio
The word poena, removed from Argynni, no longer suggests an offenoe
on his part, but suggests parenthetically the innocenoe of Paetus
falling a vietim to the cruel ongry waters. Minacis would be more
usual perhaps in this sense, but the participle is in the mannerof
Propertius. Pinder's interpretation, ‘Argynnipoeua aqrcae=Argynnus
punitus ab aqua,' is extremely harsh.

23, 24. These lines I believe to be interpolated. Theyseen
to be a dull prosy commentary by some wiseaere who imaginat
that the combination of ‘Agamemnon' ‘shore‚' and ‘sea,’ must neore
