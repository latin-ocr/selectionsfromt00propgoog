PROPERTIUS, ΙΙ. 1., 1-6. 215

5. The construction oi sive, repeated in each conplet down to
{⁵2 16, is peculiar. The usual construction of sive-sive, as of our
,π’ disjunctives ‘whether-or: is that each has a verb to itself in protasis,
³¹· while the epodosis consists of one single verb, which is applicable to
3 both or more alternatives. Thus Plaut. Trin. 1. 2. 146
seu recte seu perverse saeta sunt,
, Egomet fecisse confiteor.
'f ‘Whether it was well or badly done, I confess that I did it.’ In the
’ᾗ passage before us, each fresh alternative introduced by sive has an
’ζ epodosis of its own, so that the sense is not represented by ‘whether
’ἦ —or-or,' but by ‘If-or if-if again‚’ etc. See Ovid. Am. a. 7. 9
5 Sive bonus color est, in te quoqne fm'gn'eius esse,
3⁷⁹· Seu malus, alterius dicor amore mori.
51111. 15 again seu and sive are thrown in almost as surplusage, add-
ing nothing to the sense, which is completely expressed by the
5 summing-up words quidquid fecit, quodcumque est locuta. It is
⁵² impossible to translate seu and sive in that line, unless we allow
¹²² quitquid, quodcumque to lose their relative force t‘ whatsoever ²) and
²²²3 simply stand for ‘anything at all? A somewhat similar use of seu
35 occurs 4. 2. 11, where it joins together two principal verbs, without
5 any subordinate verb:
a« Seu, quia vertentis fructum praecepimus enni,
5· Vertumni rursm creditur esse sacrum.
3 Here seu simply means, ‘or else.' An exactly similar example occurs
3 410·47·
incedere, of the statcly, majestic welk of a tall person, or a
goddess, as Virg. Aen. r. 405, of Venus, Et aeia incessu patuit dea, ·
and of Cynthia herself, 2. 2. 6
incedit vel Iove digno soror.
cocciumconjectureofLachmenn,canscarcelyberight‚forthough
55 Cynthia was doubtless fond of gay colours <see 2. ²9· 26) a finite
verb is needed to go with sive, and it is too harsh to understand vide'
from l. 7. Some propose vidi, which would give a clumsy repe-
tition. Possibly cogis, read by some MSS„ may be right: but the
passage seems to requiie a verb in the first person. Lachmann alters
the order of the third, fourth, and fifth couplet, putting them in this
order: five, four, three. In this way the reference to the lyre comes im·
medietely after that to Apollo and her ingenium in the second conplet,
and vidi ean be supplied readily in l. 5 if preceded by ll. 7, 8.
