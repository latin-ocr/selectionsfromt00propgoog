The Latin form of the name is Ptolemaeus, correspondmg to tle
Greek Πτολεμαΐος; from this the Greek adjective would be urde-
μαίειος, which would naturally become Ptolemaeus ln Latin. Tur
MSS. audedd. vary much, asmight be expected. ·

Pharas is usually feminine, but occurs masculine in Suet Cland-
20. It is properly the name of the island still called Faro, opposite '
the mouth of the harbour of Alexandria, on which Ptolemy Phila· ἶ
delphus (reigned rac. 285-247) built his famous lighthouse. eamr
speaks of it with admiration B. C. 3. 112. Hence the word mureto
signify ‘a lighthou'se’ in general, iu which sense it is preservedin
the French pltare. The event alluded to is the capture of Alexandrir
by Octavianus in u. c. 30, which was the immediate consequence of the ·
battle of Actium. From this final victory dates the true commertar·
ment of the reign of Octavianus as the undisputed ruler of the Romu
empire. Horace celebrates the event-or rather the death of Cleo
patra which immediately succeeded it-in an ode of triumphant
exultation, 1. 37, and fifteen years afterwards he emphatically dete
the Empire of Augustus from that day: Od. 4. 14. 34

nam tibi, qua die
Partus Alexandrea supplex
Et vacuam patefecit aulam,
Fortuna lustra tertia prospero
Belli secandas reddidit exitus,
Laudemque et aptatum peractis
Imperiis decus arrogavit.
