334 NOTES.

Polygnotus. Α man called Ocnus is employed in twistlng a rope3

as last as he malres it, it is devoured by a she-ass standing athis

side. Pausanias says it is emblematis ol a hard-working husband
afflieted withan extravagant wife.

obliquo apparently refers to the man standing sideways as
regards his wite. so that he does not see what she does.

23, 24. The questions in urit, atterit are made directior
salue ol vividness.

23. urit, ‘chates :' so Hor. Epp. 1. 10: 43 ol a shoe,

Si pede nzaiar erit, subvertet, si minor, uret.

27. undasne. Lycotasis said ‘to have made his sace thin,’in·
stead of ‘to have become thin in the lace! Exactly similar is 3.rn.16‚
where the Nile is said ‘to moderate his seven channels' instead ol
‘to be moderated by having his waters divided into seven channels'

28. iste, ‘that paleness oi thine? ’

29. st marks the transition from the consideration ol his
state to hers.

induxit, ‘has ushered in.' i

31. palus are the bed coverlets, which in her restless night ἰ
she keeps tossing on to the ground. ·

uidere, used like sedere in Ov. Am. 1. a. 2

Esse quid hoc dicam qaod tam mitidum vt'dentur
Strata, nequa in lecto pallia nostra sedent?
32. Lucia auctores, ie. the cock. So Ov. Met. 11. 597
Nan vigil ales ibi cristati cantibus oris
Evocat Auroram.

33. Cp. Tibull. 1. 3. 85-88.

34. radios, ‘the shuttles,’ into which the woollen yam wls
distributed in proper lengths (secta) sor wearing. The MSS. read
gladios, which Hertz. is hall disposed to adopt as the true reading·
with the same meaning as radios, on the strength oi a line quoted
from Ennius by Nonius.

Deducunt habiles gladios fila gracilento.

But the meaning otgladzas in that passage is by no means clear.
suos, because the shnttle is the natural receptacle for the wool·
35-40. She whiles away her evenings partly in work, partlyiu

endeavouring to follow her husband’s movements on the map, and

in getting up particulars about the climate, etc, of the country heis
in. Cp. Ov. Her. 1. 31 sqq. quoted above.
For the sense os the whole cp. Sir R. Aytoun:
Meantimc my part shall be to maura,
Ta tell rte datare till thou return,
