praearmat, 11. 10.,13-18. 235

tinually to see whether heis pursuing. But the Euphrates is bere
represented as a Parthian river, not as a Roman river (Crassos se
tenuisse dalet), and there would beno point in saying that the Parthian
river was no longer running away from a victorious soe. The point
is that the Euphrates repents ol having kept the Crassi, aud declares
that his horsemen no longer cast that terrible glauce behind them.

14. munisse, ‘that it kept them,' i. e. instead of sending them
back unhurt.

15. The word tauta is probably here used in poetic exaggera·
tion. The only known relation between Augustus and India is that
an lndian embassy is mentioned amongst others as having reached
him in tac. 20 when in the East. Postgate supposes the reference
to be to a previous embassy of which Dion Cassius speaks in vague
terms, 54. 9. The poet speaks grandly‚ as though the whole East
were submitting to Augustus3 the only foundation in fact for such a
boast being that Augustus was meditating an expedition against
Arabia, and had begnn to intrigue in Parthian affairs. Arabia was
probably looked upon vaguely as being on the road to India;
hence Horace couples the two together, Od. 3. 24. 1

Intactis opulentior
Thesauris Arabum et dabitis Indiae.

16. mamus, ‘nnrifled’

Arabtaa The allusion is tc the disastrous expedition against
Arabia, conducted by Aelius Gallus in rac. ²4· Horace alludes tc
this expedition, od. r. ²9· 1

Icci, beatis nuuc Arabum invides - . pel,
Gaza's.

As the commentators point out, the words te tremit point to atime
previous to the disaster.

Arahtu has here the first syllable long, for sake of the metre, as
in 1. 14. 19. Poets allow themselves great license in the case of
proper names. Thus we have ltblus and Iratus, Slcdmls, Sr'cbnltls
and hicanis, Cyitlrirb and Cytblrrib, and we need not feel squeamish
about admitting Apula uae by siue with sipara in the muen-
tortured passage Hor. Od. 3. 4. 9, 10

Me fabulosae Vulturc in Appula
Altricis extra limen Apuliae,
where noue of the proposed emendations deserve adoption.

l'l, 18, These lines complete the circle of prophetie boastsul-
ness. The reference in l. 17 is of course tc Britain. So Horace in
Od. 1. 21. 13, an Ode which was probably written in' uc. 28, pro·
phesies victories to Augustus over East and West at'rkez
