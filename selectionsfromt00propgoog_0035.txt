xxviii INTRODUCYION

ceded hya few years by that of Huschke, 1819. Lach-

mann relied mainly upon five MSS„ none of them older
than the fifteenth century. These MSS. were all, accord·
ing to the fashion of the scholars of that time, much inter-
polated; the interpolations being due not only to the
copying of readings from other MSS, but also, in many
cases, to sheerinvention. Lachmann was also acquainted
with the readings noted by J. Scaliger from an old MS. of
Extracts from Booksl and ΙΙ, possessed by Vincentius
Bellovacensis, awriter of the thirteenth century ; with the
readings of the fragment of a MS. which Scaliger received
from Cuiaccius ; and with the readings of Franciscus
Puccius, many of which were derived from a very old MS.
But he was not able to exhibit the true connection between
these Mss.; and the text has been put upon a new foot-
ing by the edition of Baehrens (1878), who claims to have
discovered two MSS. of the first importance, and to have
established the true relationship subsisting between the
existing MSS. The following is the account he gives of
the various MSS. F irst in importance is

A or Codex Ambrosianus. discovered by Baehrens in
the Ambrosian Library of Milan in 1876. It is on parch-
ment, of quarto shape, contains only Tibullus in forty·
eight leaves of twenty-two lines each, the last being blank.
At the end, after the ‘Vita Tibulli,’ are the words, Liber
Colyciz' pym' Cancellarii florentini, and, added in a
different hand, Liber Cosme Johannis de Medicis. It is
written in a beautiful hand, and has few mistakes Its
date is probably about 1374, as we know that Colutz'us
Salutatus was hunting up copies of Propertius and Ca·
tullus about that time. lt has been corrected 'here and
there by a hand some fifty years later. Very like this MS„
but inferior, is

V or Codex Vaticanus, on paper‚ folio size, containing
Tibullus on leaves 1-37‚ and also Ovid’s Remedia Amoris.
lt is probably of the end of the thirteenth or beginning of
