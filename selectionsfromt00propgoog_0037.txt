sages from Tibullus which are to be found in two MSS.
ol the Florilegium now at Paris (Mus. Rhen, vol. 25,
p. 369). Many oi the readings are corrupt, and entirely
bad, but those that are good seem to be derived from a
different family from A V, and to present great similarity
to the readings ol G. Wherever Par. has a good
reading, G agrees with it; where its reading is bad, it
agrees rather with AV. Hence Baehrens holds that A
and V were derived from one common parent, while G and
Par. were derived from another and older parent, belong-
ing possibly to the tenth or eleventh centuries. These
two supposed MSS. however, though unequal in age, were
themselves probably derived from a common archetype
, whose supposed readings designated by the sign O, are
to be ascertained from the consensus of the three MSS.
A.V.G., supported by the readings of Par. where available.

But this is not all. There were at one time in existence
two other MSS. oi Tibullus, distinct both from each other
· and from Ο. Of one of these MSS. some fragments are
preserved in the collection called

Excerpta Frisingensia, now at Munich, in a MS.
of the eleventh century, and taken apparently from a MS.
older and better than 0¹. Some excellent readings have
been preserved in these extracta especially that adopted
in this edition in 1. 1. 25. The other MS. is preserved only
in the

Fragment called F. This is the ancient fragment
which Scaliger received from Jacobus Cuiaccius, on the
readings os which Lachmann placed a high value. 'It
began only from 3. 4. 65, and as the MS. itself has dis-
appeared, only such os its readings were preserved as
Scaliger thought fit to write out on to his own copy of the
Plantinian edition of our poet (1560). That copy is now
