206 NOTES.

11. 37 Metuebant erem servi, verebantur liberi, and Phil υ. init
Quid ἰ) Veteranorum veremur? nam tierreri se ne ipsi quelle:
velient. The same eontrast is brought out in Ad Quint ιω]
Liv· aa· 37· 17·

2. moror. Just as Virgil's nec dona moror, Aen. 5. 4⁰⁰,
means ‘1 ‹lo not stop the gists‚' ‘1 let them go past me,' andso‘l
do not care for them3' so here moror fata means, ‘1 woulddn
nothing to arert,’ and so ‘am indifferent to.’

extrem, an ornamental, intensiiying epithet. It is not „sedin
part oii one kind of rogus from another-as in such common phun
as extremo tempore, etc—but to indicate a quality which is nni
versal: ‘ the pile which is life’s end’ The word is used in moll!
the same way in 1. 17. 23 ;

Illa merem extremo clamasset pulvere nomen,
and in 3. 2. 18 (20)
tilertis ab extrema conditione vacant.

uenite fata rogo. Nothing can be more crude and unpoetinl Ι
than to say, with Kinnoel and Pinder, that fata ‘stands sor “a
dead body'' ;' or, with Paley, that it is a periphrasis ior satu
rogi, whatever that might mean. Surely neither poetry nor mee
requires anything to ‘stand for’ so fine a phrase as ‘Nor world
I stay the sate that is my funeral pyre's due? ἱ

3. ne goes with He'c tierior est, the emphatic Hic being ex·
planatory os the sentence iterarent: ‘But 1 leave a sear-e ieu
more stem than death itself-that thy love may be absent from nr
burial.’

5.1²uer isos course Cupid. It is possible, as Hertzberg
suggests, that there may have been running through the poet's mind
a conceit which hc illustrates from two passages from the Greel
Anthoiogy, according to which the eyes of Aphrodite are re·
presented as anointed with bird-lime to enable her to catch her
prcy. This is bad enough; but when Paley translates this into
‘The lover goes about with his eyes smeared to catch Cupid ute
flies, and so is unable to shake him off again‚' the idea beeone
intolerable. The eyes are the seat of Love; it is through the eyes
that Love is caught up and answered. Olivia in Twelfth Night says,

Methe'nks Iseel tln‘s yoeetlr's peefictz'ons,
With aee invisible and seebtle stealtlr,
T o ereep in at nn'ne eyes.
It was by the eyes that Cynthia first captured Propertius, 1. r. 1
Cynthia prima suis miumm me cepit ocellis.

The figure therefore of Cupid having settled on the poet's eyes, aul
