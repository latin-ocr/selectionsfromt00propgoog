In sacris the idea is no doubt that so caresully worked out by
Horace, Od. 3. 1.1-4. There the poet represents himself as the
priest oi the Muses; at the Muses' feast, and in their name, he gives
forth his holy song; as at a solemn sacrifice, no words of evil omen
are to be heard; and hc sings to none but to the pure ears oiboys
and maidens. Akin to this is the idea in 3. r. 3puro deserete ,
sacerdos, where the water is from the Muses' spring, to be used in
purilying the worshippers. See too 4. 6. 1-10 and note.

25. Ascra was a village in Boeotia, near Mount Helicon, iamed

Permessus, which has its source in the celebrated inspiring spring of
Aganippe. The sense thus is, ‘I have not yet climbed up to the
source of the Muses‘ stream, and quafsed at the fountain-head3 I
have been but dipped by Love in its lower reaches?

the former cp. iocosi munera Liberi Hor. Od. 4. 15. 26.

uno teoto is of course the couch of the funeral-bien uno
