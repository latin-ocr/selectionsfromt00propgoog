TIBULLUS, 11. 5., 27-53. 169

1 ‘dition pointed to Alba Longa as the cradle of the race: thus the
ff* Trojans had to he brought to Alba. But how was Alba to be reached
by a small colony arriviug by sea? They sail up the Tiber, laud
near its mouth, on the territory of Latinus, king of Laurentum. Their
Ι first encampment is called laurentia castra Aen. 10. ⁶35· The
²³⁵ war over, Aeneas marries Lavinia, and founds a new settlement,
²¹² which he calls after his wife Lavinium, well on the way to Alba.
'32³ Thirty years later his son Ascanius moves the remaining step, and
transfers the govemment to Alba. The motive of the whole story is
³² plain. The laumas still grows in profusion on the low sandy tract
where Aeneas landed.

Qappellant. See Ov. Met. 14. 598. Topographers generally
identify a small stream called the Rio T orto with the Numicius;
and Pratica, which lies close to it, with Lavinium.

440m10msserrt. Note the construction. It is not so much 3.
that caelo stands for ad caelum, as that miserit has a trajective force: . ³01
‘hauded over t0,' ‘transferred' In the case of caelumffite idea of pa ,η
motion towards, as if it were a terrestrial journey‚ is put out of sight. d Αἱ
Thus Italiae miserit would be impossible.

47.msm1uoeus. Agood example of the Dat. Ethicus. ‘I
see the camp blazing.' Here the camp of Turnus is bumt: an iuci-
dent not given by Virgil.

49. Ante oeulos, i. e. in prophecy: she sees the whole future
course of Roman history.

51. placitura. Cp. above, 3. 35. Here, of course, no inten-
tion is signified: ‘destined to find favour in the eyes of.’ y

52. deseruisse. The effect of the perfect here (with the ·' -
present-perfect sense) is to add vividness, as if the scene were being
enacted before her eyes: ‘thou hast left the Vestal hearth.’

53. furum, going closely with concubitus, has the force ot an
adjective. The explanation is not so much that the phrase is a
Graecism, = τὰς λάθρα συνουσίας, as Orelli puts it-a mode of
expression contrary to the genius of Latin, which has no article-
but rather it is an elliptical phrase, the adverb being taken with a
participle suggested naturally by the context. Thus iterum consul
stands for iterum consul creatus; populum late regem Virg. Aen. 1.

'21 suggests late regnantem ,· emtus circa populi Liv. is short for
circa habitantes.
