proruamur, 1. 19, 2-8. 207

elung to them so finnly that it was inconceivable that he should
leave him when dead, and allow his remains to be neglected by her
whom he had loved, is a' persectly natural and beautiful idea. The
idea os the Anthology is quite different. There Venus, or the
wmisters of Venus, anoint their eyes with bird· lime thatt they may
catch the lover3 here Love has sastened himself so firmly on to the

lover's eyes, that he cannot be iorgot ten by love, even ast ter death
The old song says

Leve m her eyes sits playzng;
Shalespeare thinks· rt necessary to controvert the common opinion,
when he says,
Leve looks not with the eyes but with tlte mind. '

6. oblito, generally taken in a passive sense, as in Virg. E. 9.
53 Nunc oblita arilei tot carmina. So also Val. Flac. 2. 38. 8.
But is this necessary? Could it not be taken in aquasi-proleptic
sense, to mean ‘Leve has not clung so lightly to my eyes that my

' ashes oen be left untended bya sorgetting love? L. 3shows that

’ tlreamore is nothis love for her, but hers for him3 it is her forget·
fulness of him which he dreads· Thus oblito amore vacet means
‘shall lie unhonoured by a love—a love that has forgotten me’
In other words, there is a double predication combined iu one ex-
pression. He might either have said ‘that my ashes should be
unhonoured by Love,’ or that ‘Love should be forgetful ol my

Ι ashes! Here both phrases are welded into one. Moore brings out
this meaning:

Teo well I've loved, too blz'ndly‚ that my bier

, Should be unlronoured by o single tear.

· Pinder’s explanation ‘Not even in death will thy love be sor-
gotter by me’ misses the point. Is it possible that vacet may be
used absolutely, ‘lack the honour due to it,’ as uncultivated lands
are said vacare? oblito amore would then be the ablative absolute,
‘mylove forgetting' ‘through the iorgetfulness of my love.⁹ Cp.

411· 94 caelibi, ad curas nec vacet ulla via.

ἰ 7. Phylacides. Protesilaus is meant, whose father Iphiclus

s , was sonos Phylacus. The love of Protesilaus for Laodamia is

'¹ well-known from Ov. Her. 13. He obtained leave from the gods
²⁰ return to see her sor a single day.
