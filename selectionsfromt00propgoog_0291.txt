224' NOTES.

llere. the vitium or ‘weakness' referred to is of course Properti&
love for Cynthia. In the preceding lines he has decluedtlaul
maladies can be cured except lore.

66. nantuac. mua. I have retained, though not without
hesitation, the reading of the Mss, ou the principle that ι lh
reading should not be rejected if a satisfactory sense can heer-

tracted from it. Taretalea manu, if correct, would mean ‘widila
hund of Tantalus,' or ‘with the hand of a Tantalus ;’ aud uouit
the dative would be more natural aiter tradere, it is perfectlygoof
sense to speak of ‘ offering, or passing on, apples with the hand oft
Tantalus’ In the Odys. 11. 581, where the position of Tantalusir
‹lescrihed emphasis is laid on the fact that he cannot reach the frui,
etc, rur'lh his hand (see the passage quoted on Tib. 1. 3. 77); eni
to insert the phrase by using trudere instead of some word mi!
to rcach or obtain, is quite iu the style of Propertius. The μὴ(
was that Tantalus could not handle, though he could see, the appla:
so Propertius can feel, but cannot remove, his own weekness. ‘Tu
hand apples to Tantalus’ is a different idea, and imperta anuh
person into the scene. At the same time, Tantaleae is a veli
tempting correction. Propertius nowhere uses the dative in -ur'xiu
1. 11. 12 he has the contracted form

Alternae facilis cedere lympha mame,

und again, 2. 19. 19, reddere pinu Cornua. The same form ocem
Tac. Ann. 3. 30, 33, 6. ²3· Horace has the similar form fidefor
fidei Od. 3. 7. 4, and Virg. Geo. 1. 208 has die for diei. lie
correction to Tantalea is just the correction which an ignom
scribe would make. A similar doubt as between the dative ruf
the ablutive occurs in 4. 6. aa, where Palmer adopts the reading

Pilaque feretineae turpiter apta nranu.

Just as in this passage, N. reads the ablativo serm'uca mm.
though apta (as here tradere) suggests the dative, and the datire,
on the whole, is best suited to the sense of the passage. See nota

67. virgineis, referring to the 49 Danaids, who, for murder-
ing their husbands on their bridal night, were condemned to poll
water everlastingly into a bottomless cask.

idem. Note the Latin idiom by which, when two 1st
‹licatcs are referred to a common subject, the English also is repre·
sented not by etiam, but by idem, agreeing with the subject. Cp
lior. Od. a. 19. 28
