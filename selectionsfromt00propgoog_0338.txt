PROPERTIUS‚ ΙΙΙ. 2., 20-233 111. 3., 1-7. 271

1. vim eram goes with recubans and hiscere posse, ‘Me-
thought I lay, and dreamed I could: etc.

molli, with reference partly to the easy loungin'g of the poet's
life, as Hor. has it Od. 1. 1. 21

nunc viridi ntembra sub arbuto
Stratus, nunc ad oquae lene caput sacrae,
(ep. the phrase vita umbratilis, etc), partly to the character of ama·
tory p'oetry. See above note on 3. 1. 19.

2. Bellerophontei. See note on 3. 1. 19. Cp. caballinus fons,
‘the hack‘s spring,’ Pers. Prol. 1.

4. wantum operta. A common phrase = Tantum opus.
The words are in apposition to the whole sentence. ·So Virg. Aen.
6. 223 ΜΝ ’ωε tyri ofni ¹

pars ingenti subiere feretro,
Triste ministerium, et subiectam more parentum

Aversi tenuere facem3

ib. ro. 311
primus turmas invasit agrestes

Aeneas, omen pugnae.
The construction is commonet in Greek than in Latin.

nervis htsoere posse, ‘thatIhad strength to gaspforth! Ner· f ¹
vus means ‘a muscle,' and is the regular term for denoting physical βπ
strength. Hence nervosus is ‘ muscular,’ ‘powerful :' Quis Aristotech
nervosior? Cic. Brut. 31. 121, and so our phrase ‘nervous energy.' st ⁵

hiscere, ‘to lisp,’ or ‘gasp,' because of the greatness of the task.
Hisco implies generally that atterance is choked by sear, nervousnesS,
sense of guilt, etc.

5. rar-va oea, of small unworthy lips, with reference to sontibus;
not surely parallel to os magnum 2. 10. 11 (where see note) or os
rotundum Hor. A. P. 323. In a passage imitated from this Pers.
Prol. 1 uses labra prolui, ‘soased my lips.¹

6. pater, a term of respect to Ennius, as the father of Ro
song. So Hor. Epp. 1. 19. 7: cp. id. 1. 1. 50 'eleo effl‘ff

Ennius et sopiens ct fortis et alter Homerus.

ψ 7. curios for Curiatios: the form does not occur elsewhere
For Horatia cp. note on 3. 1. 11. As Postgate points out, Horatio
pilo may refer either to the column in the Forum on which the spoils
ot the conquered Curiatii were hung, or to the arms themselves
(Bum's Rome, p. 104). But it is possible that there is also an allu-
sion to the pilum, the characteristic weapon os the Roman legions.
The MSS. read cecinit, doubtless from the neighbourhood oi

Ennius, and not understanding the coherence ol uepasage. buz
