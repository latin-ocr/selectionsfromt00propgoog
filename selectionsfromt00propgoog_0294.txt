lress was calculated more to set off the beauty oi the ligure as a
thole, than to call special attention to the iace. Our word ⁸ figure'
s ouen so narrowed as to refer to the waist only; but no ancient
tatae has a slender waist, and the ankles os all the most celebrated
tatues oi Venus-as e. g. the Venus de Medici and the Venus οἱ

ten. 1. 46, in a passage probably imitated here by Propertius:

¹1. Aut cnm Pallas aflatus is wrongly explained by
iertzberg as a kind ol anacoluthon. The peculiarity ol the con·
ruction is that Pallas is placed by attraction inside the clause
spendent on cum instead oi outside it. The meaning is ‘ she moves
very Juno ora Pallas.’ ‘she moves as a sister worthy ol Jove, oras
allas avlam she walks belore the altars! The change suggested to
t cum is no improvement, aut ut would make the sense clear were

not too violent a change. The difficulty is that the particle
' comparison is omitted: Propertius does not say ‘She moves as
rno or Pallas,’ but actually identilying Cynthia with the goddess
ι whom she is compared: ‘She walks a sister worthy ol Juno or
allas when,’ etc.

’1. Dulichias. Dulichium was one of the group of islanda
lled Echinades, off the coast ol Acarnania. Homer, 11.2.625,
eaks oi ‘Dulichium and the sacred islanda Echinae, which lie
yond the sea, opposite to Elis' Strabo identifies Dulichium with
‚e os the islands called Dolicha (Δολίχα) in his day. The island
rmed part oi the kingdom ol Ulysses, and was therefore probably
e seat oi the worship ol his special patroness Pallas.

8. It is evident that at Dulichium the goddess was worshipped
her martial character, and represented in complete warlike array,
th the aegis on her breast.
