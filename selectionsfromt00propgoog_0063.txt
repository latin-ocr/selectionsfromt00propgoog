he the oldest and most authoritative of all. Baehrens
dates it about 1430: he regards it therefore as a MS. ol

the interpolated type, belonging to the same family as
A. F ., but taking some of its readings lor D. V., and dis·
figured in some places by Italian conjectures, in others
by reproducing the corrections ol Fl. and V2. But M.
Plessis, as we have seen, upsets Baehrens' dates on
palaeographic grounds: he makes N. some 200 years
older, V. some 50 years younger, than does Baehrens:

while he regards A. D. F. as being all about the same
age, viz. ol the end of the fourteenth century. F urther,
both Mr. Ellis¹ and Μ. Plessis havelpointed out various
passages in which A.F.D.V. are all corrupt, while N. alone
has preserved the true reading: while both F . Leo aud
M. Plessis point out that wherever F2. and ΜΒ. agree with
N, the reading is correct. In addition, N. is distinctly
superior in orthography; it does not give the lalse name
of Aurelius or Nauta to the poet ; and Mr. Ellis¹ has in·
geniously shown that even in passages where it blunders,
it blunders because the copyist preferred faithfully to
copy the MS. before him, rather than introduce obvious
corrections. Final]y‚ M. Plessis' view as to the date of N.
is confirmed by Mr. E. Maunde Thompson, os the British
Museum, an authority of the highest mark 2.

From these arguments the conclusion remains that Ν,
is the best existing MS, being the oldest representative
of the family A.F.; that D.V. form another family, equal to
A. F. but inferior to N.; that the corrections of Fl. and V‘.
have been largely taken from N. or from some equally
good MS.; while G. and H. G. have mixed in an uncer-
tain degree the readings of the two families A careful
examination of the readings given in the critical notes
