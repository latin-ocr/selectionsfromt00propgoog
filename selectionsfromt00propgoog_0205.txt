muer, the Loire. Itwillbenoted that Tibullus takescuiis
sweep through the names of Gaul, and by uo means confines bineli
to Aquitania. The epithet caerulo must either refer to the mutius
the Loirc, with its sea water, or else be an unmeaning gereni
epithet applicable to streams in general; ior no epithet couldbeles
applicable to the loire itsels.⁴ As a rule, the Roman poets hrt·
true eye ior streams and rivers, aud generally describe rhaab
characteristic terme. Their descriptions οἱ mountain or lom
scenery, ou the other hand, arc in the last degree conventioncl rud
vague.

13. The poet now passes on to describe Messalla's exploltsiu

os placiule aquis Itis impossible, as some propose, to take thet
words as datives sor ad aquas, ‘creepest on to the calm ναίεις oltlt

16. mat, the MS. reading, is obviously corrupt, and dl
editors now agree in substituting atat. This makes good senet:
ior Strabo tells us that Mouut Taurus was cultivated to the πη·
summit. The construction of the passage requires the subjuucu're
mood, and even is it were not so, the idea that Taurus arat Cilices
can be equivalent to Cilices arant T aurocen, gravely put forwerdby
Scaliger, is as absurd as to say that ‘the cat killed the mouse'is
equivalent to ‘the mouse killed the cat’ Scarcely less absurdis
H.’s interpretation ‘Mount Taurus cuts through or traverses the
land of the Ciliciens’ Mount Taurus does nothing os the kind, nor
can the Latin be made to say so
