xxxiv INTRODUCTION

η ‘In the plain below where the rich fertile landos
Umbria comes closest-there was Ι born ς’

ie. he was bom in the rich plain ol Umbria, at the
point where it comes closest up to the walls of Perusia.
It is impossible that in these words Umbria as a whole
can be referred to: he clearly means to specify the par·
ticular pa1t of Umbria with which he was connected.

2. In 4.1.61-66 he proclaims himself to be an Um·
brian, and speaks in vague terms of his genius being con-
nected with a city or 'cities set upon a height above the
plain τ’

Ennius hirsuta cingat sera dicta cararia:

Ul nastris tumefacta superbiat Umbria libris,
Umbria Romani patria Callimachi.
ι, Scandentes quisquis cernit de vallibus arces
Ingenia maros aestirrret ille rara

‘Let Ennius crown his sayings with rugged wreath: but
hand thou to me, Bacchus, a chaplet of thine own ivy,
that Umbria be lifted up and boast her of my lays—Um·

ever sees yon heights climbing out of the valley,—-by my
genius let him rate those walls!

There is nothing in these words to show that Pro·
pertius had any particular town in view, or that he meant
to speak of such town as his birthplace.

3. More definite information is afforded by 4.1. 121—
126 ‹

, Umbria te natis antiqua Penatibus edit:

(tlientiort an patriae tangitur ora tinet)
Qua nebulosa cava rarat Mevania campa,
Et lacus aestivis intepet Unrber aquis,

Scandentisqrre arcis camnrgit vertice marris,-
Maras ab ingenio natzar ille tna.

‘Thy birthplace is ancient Umbria, in a home well-
