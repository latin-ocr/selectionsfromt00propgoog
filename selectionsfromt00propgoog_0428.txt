alternative,
Altera materni se exaequat turba Libones,

in which case turba would be idiomatic in apposition with a plural
noun. ,
32. domna auoque, ‘both sides of the house!
attalia, in the same sense as in Hor.Od.4.14.4
Per titulos memoresque justos.

33. praetexta The name given to the toga of childhood,
whether of boys or girls, because it had an edge of purple or scarlet
running round it. This maidens laid aside at marriage for the stela.

freeborn maidens and matrons to keep in the hair. It is thought

37-42. She calls to witness her ancestors—the Africani and
L. Aemilius Paullus-that she has maintained the purity of the
house umblemished.

38. Captives had their hair shaved: and the editors are
probably right in supposing that Propertius had in his eye a trophy
erected to the Scipios with an inscription above, and at the foot a
shaved captive representing the conquered Africa-like the eight
statues of Dacian captives built into the architraves of the Arch of
Constantine. The word tonsa however has the further meaning of
‘fleeced‚’ ‘stripped bare‚' as iu Plaut. Bacch. a. 3. 8Hunc tondebo
