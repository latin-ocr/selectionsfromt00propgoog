PREFACE. Α >fiii

tage of being able tonse an edition of extracts published
by the late Professor William Ramsay. Some of the
longer notes of that excellent scholar are too valuable to
be lost, and Ι have quoted them in full within inverted
commas.

In conclusion, Ι have to express my warm acknowledg-
ments to Professor A. Palmer. Not only have Ι been
largely guided by his admirable edition of the text, but he
has rendered me substantial service by most kindly look·
ing over my proofS, and by offering many valuable sug·
gestions, which he has allowed me to incorporate in the
notes. Ι owe much also to the edition of Mr. Postgate,
whose selections coincide with those of this edition to the
extentos some five hundred lines. His masterly Intro-
duction is a most important addition to the fruits of British
scholarship; and if I have ventured to differ from him
occasionally in the notes, Ι have done so with much diffi-
dence, and with a full sense of the authority with which
he speaks. My best thanks also are due to Professor
E. L. Lushington for kindly lurnishing me with the
materials for the Egyptian note on Tibullus 1. 7. 283
to Professor Veitch and the Rev, A. S. Aglen for sug-
gesting to me some excellent illustrations3 and to G. S. R.
for the compilation of the Index.
