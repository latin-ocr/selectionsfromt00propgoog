INTRODUCTION TO PROPERTIUS.

Life of Propertius.

OF the life and circumstances of Propertius we know
little or nothing except what is recorded by himself, of can
be gathered from a carelul examination of his poems.
Such an examination will tell us much of the poet’s ch'a·
racter, and enable us to construet for ourselves a tolerably
complete picture of the man, of his temper and his tastes,
of the strength and tenderness of his feelings‚ as well as
of the characteristic features and limitations of his genius τ
but it will furnish us with a very meagre account of the
external incidents of his life. His poems are essentially
poems of feeling, not of incident or description : and they
revolve in a round so narrow, so intense, that beyond the
special circumstances by which the feeling was called
forth, they give little or no clue to the surroundings in
which his life was passed. His love and his poetry were
his all: and in leaving these behind him, he ‘has left us
the best record of hislife.

His full name, so far as we know it, was Sextus Pro-
pertius. -The praenomen does not occur in his writingS,
noris it given in any MS.: but it is distinctly attributed
. to him by Donatus in his Life ofVirgil. Many MSS.
and, until recen'tly, most editions, give him the additional
name Aurelium sometimes before, sometimes after, the
Propertius: but apart from the improbability of a double
gentile name being borne at so early a date as the time of
PropertiuS, it is likely that a mistake has arisen from
a confusion with the name of the poet Prudentius, whose
full name was Aurelius Prudentius Clemens. Many
MSS. add Nauia to the poet’s name, as an agnomen: but
this mistake has been shown to arise from a false reading
