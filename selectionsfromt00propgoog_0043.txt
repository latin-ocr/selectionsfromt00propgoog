xxxvi INTRODUCTION

set on the top of a hill, doubtless the same town as that
described in l. 65 in almost identical words:

Scandentes si quis cernet de vallibus orces ,·

and areis, not Asis, is the true reading. The town indi-
cated is one of the towns in the valley of the Clitumnus,
but it was not Asisium.

But even if Asisi were the true reading, the words of
Propertius do not indicate more than that he was born in
the neighbourhood of that town. Itis clear that the poet
here specifies a district, not a town. He again gives Um·
bria as his birthplace; patriae orabas reference to what
follows, and specifies the particular part of the province
with which he was connected. This is then described as
the part where the dank Mevania drips with moisture on
a plain, where waters steam from the Umbrian lake in
summer, and where the walls of a city rise up on a height.
No known lake would satisfy the conditions of the lacus
Umber: so the phrase is generally supposed to refer to a
part of the river Clitumnus, which, according to the
younger Pliny, 8. 8. 1-3, spreads out into a broad glassy
pool not farbelow its source. The fact then that Propertius
describes his Penates as being in a part of Umbria lying
close under Perusia, where lay Mevania and the Umbrian
lake, and the town set on a hill, is proof that he means to
specify no particular town, but only to indicate a spot in
the Clitumnus valley within reach of all the places he has
named. The phrase noti Penates no doubt refers to the
farm of which Propertius’ father was depriired in the con-
fiscations of Β. e. 42, and implies that it was a property of
some importance. It was in all probability situated
nearer to Asisium than to the other towns named above,
for the names Propertius and Propertio occur on several
inscriptions found in or near that city. There is also evi·
dence to show that he was claimed as a municeps of that
town in the century after his death. For there exists at
Assisi a stone with the following inscription:
