be to the commonplaoe subject oi the excluded lover, pouring out ι
his sorrows to the door which shuts him out. See the whole poem,
' 1.16. Baehrens’ conjecture soliis is tempting. It is in harmony
with the piece, containing a pathetic assurance on the part of the
· poet, in the very moment that recalls to him his wrongs, that he has
breathed them to none but the silent leaves.

quae is a general neuter, referring to curas: ‘matters which
are known only,' etc.

25. Note the contrast of timidus and superbae.

26. argaeo . . . dolore, a grief that vents itself in words.

27. The address to the Fonntuins and their Naiads, implied in ,
'the usual punctuation, is somewhat abrupt, and it seems better to
leave the question open whether sorites is the nominative or the
vocative. The only reason for supposing it to be the latter is con·
tained in the epithet divini, which is inconsistent with frigida,

inculto, dura, all pointing to the hardships of the poet's present ,

surroundings. But this is outweighed by the ambiguity and harsh·
ness of taking the words out of their natural sequence :divini fontes
et frigida nepes ct. . . dura quies. The conjecture dumosi orontes
is quite unnecessary. Mr. R. Ellis, Journal of Phil. vol. xv. p. 12,
has made the ingenious conjecture Clusini fontes. Divini is out
os place; and he suggests a coincidence with the passage in Horace,
Epp. 1. 15· 5, where Horace complains that Baiae and its hot ·
springs were being deserted for the cold iounts of Clusium. Pro-
pertius, sick with love or ill, may have retired ior change of air to
Clusium, and poured forth this eighteenth elegy in some unfre-
quented spot in the neighbourhood.

...pr ..a Ἣ affl it?

A beautiful and touching elegy‚ written apparently 1n anticipation
of an early death, and, with the exception of the relief afforded by
the two concluding lines, in a tone of deep despondency. The poet
is filled with terror at the thought that Cynthia may forget him
when dead, while he vows that his own‘love will endure beyond the ,
grave. Let them enjoy their love, at least, while they live.

1. vereor, seldom ii ever used with exactly the same sense
as timeo or nretuo. Cicero carefully distinguishes the words, Seu.
