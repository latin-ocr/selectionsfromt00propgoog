TO PROPERTIUS. xlvii

nature, at once sensitive and passionate as it was: and
the twenty-third and twenty-fourth poems of Book IV

show how for a time at least it converted the tenderest
of poets into the bardest. When there was no longer y
a Cynthia, there could no longer be Cynthia poems ε but

some of the finest‚ to a modern taste probably tlte finest, “
os the poems of Propertius are written on subiects in
which Cynthia had no place; and there is no need to
exaggerate the influence which she exercised on bis
genius, and for that purpose to set aside the presumption
afforded by the order of the poems as handed down to us
that some of the noblest and most beautiful of his poems
were composed after his love for Cynthia was a thing
of the past. The fevered dissipation of his first youth
no doubt left its effects behind, and the exuberance olbis
early muse departed from him ; but no dimness of poetic
faculty, no seared beart, can be attributed to the poet who
wrote the third and the eleventh poems of the Fourth
Book3 and the latter, as we have seen, was written not
earlier than B. e. 16,

Another argument, which is almost conclusive, can be
drawn from the development in the structure of the
elegiae couplet, and especially of the pentameter, whichcan
be traced in the poems as they stand. In Books l and II
Propertius constantly ends his pentameters with words of
three, four, and five syllables: the number of such end·
ings is far rarer in Book 111, and ceases almost entirely
in Book IV: in seven out of the eleven poems of that
book not one of these endings occur. The following table
will show at a glance how the facts stand :—

Book 1. 11. ΠΙ. IV.
Trisyllabic endings ............... 35 15 1 1
Quadrisyllabie endings ............ 88 53 10 4
Quinquesyllabic endings ............ 8 7 1 1

The above table speaks for itself. lt shows that as the
books proceed, Propertius eschews more and more all
