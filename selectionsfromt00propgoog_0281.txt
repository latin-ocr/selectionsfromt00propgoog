in lnying hold of the whole intelleet of a people which had justris
to its full intellectnal strength, and ln attaching to himselfnd:
govemment, as enthusiastic champions, the master-minds iuwh
that intellectnal strength was embodied. Napoleon 111 tried in r.
to attach to himself the intellect of Franoe, aud he fell: Augu
succecded. And if we reflect how weary os the display ol h
force, how polished, how receptive ot ideas, how sensitire to arn
form, was the Rome of the Augustas age, we can without diffluo
understand how irresistible was the force exerted upon the imaginat
os the time by a cause which was accepted as a fundamental urieli
saith by its noblest spirits, which was proclaimed as a gospel,r
ardently advocated on every ground-personat, political, literana
gious—bythe whole power osa literaryclnster οἱ whichVirgil, Hon
Livy, Ovid, Propertius, aud Tibullus were, aster all, only the brigh
stars. All this advocacy was obtained silently, and mainlythru
the instrumentality of Maecenas With Propertius, as with Heu
Maecenas used all his indecore, under cover of a regnrd for
literary reputation, to induce him to tum his muse to higher thet!
to urge her to soar a higher flight3 Propertius, like Horace, uu

power been his, he would have chosen to sing of the explora
Caesar and Maecenas before all other topies: but he must ue

refrain, like Horace, Od. 1. 6. 9, Dum pudor

Imbellisque lyrae Musa potem vetat
Laudes egregii Caesaris et tuas
Culpa deterere ingeni.
