According to the view os Brugsch (Religion u. Mythologie da
alten Aegypter, 1884) and that oi many recent Egyptologers, the
fundamental conception ol the Egyptian religion was that there was
one universal divine esseuce, which expanded itself into variam
distinct denies, such as Ra, Amen, Ptalr, Osiris ; while by a reverse
proeesS, each os these derived deities might also assume the t'orm und
the attributes os the one supreme originating power. Thus Aicnit
distinctivcly the primal water clement, from which all things were
formed hythe one soul os the whole, which is at once identical with,
und yet distinct from it; and Ra is the principal title for the Suu,
who is oue main symbol of the divine permeating force. Yetiu
localities specially sacred to Amen, he may bc invoked, not only
under his own name, but also as Amen-Nam, or as Ammga, Ra
is especially thc rising Suu, as Tum or Atum is the setting Suu t aad ,
as thc Sun sets and rises again, so Osiris is held-to live again atter ῑ
