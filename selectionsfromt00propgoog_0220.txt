Nemes, Ι. Ιο., 11-27. 153

cunctam. So a. r. 22 addressing the Genius Natalis,
Ludat et ante tues turba novella pedes.

18. vetem seems here used almost as = senis. There is

perhaps the additional implication that he is speaking oi a time long
one by.

g 1'9. mouns tenuere fidem, i. e. the men oi those days were
simplet and more true.

cultu refers to ornaments. ἵ

20. aede angue, i.e. the Lararium.

21. Note the difference between uve, ‘a bnnch of grapes3'
racemus, ‘a bough with leaves and clusters ;' acerem, ‘a single berry?
Juvenal fitly compares a hive os bees swarming to a uva, 13. 68

Examenque apium longa consederit uva
Culmine delubri.

ln the present passage uva is used for ‘wine'

23. von compos. Votum is properly ‘a vow :’ i. e. a prayer
accompanied by a promise that is the thing prayed ior be granted,
some offering or service shall be given in return sor it. Being thus
a promise accompanied by a condition, the word is used sometimes
specially os the promise, sometimes specially os the condition. Thus
voti conpos means ‘having gained or become possessed of the thing
prayed f0r3' voti reus, veti danaenatus, mean ‘having become bound
to sulfil the promise‚' i.e. in consequence of having obtained the
prayer. laboth cases the same fact is stated, only from a different

point of view.
24. So Ov. Fast. a. 651

Inde ubi ter fruges erudies immisit e'n egnes,
Peragit incisos ſsle'a paena sevos.

26. hostiaque is joined in the prayer with Lares, as being
able to secure his safety.
melca is read by good MSS. and isa safer reading than mys-
tica. On the other harrd, it was less likely to be changed to mystica
than vice versa: and mystica derives confirmation from χοιρία μυσ-
τηρικά, χοίρους μυστηρικάς Arist. Ach. 747, 764, in connection with
the worship oi Ceres. So Virg. has mystica vuinus Iacchi, and Tib.
3. 6. 1 mystica vites, in connection with the worship os Bacchus.
Rustica can only mean ‘as a humble country offering? Horace
mentions both percae and myrtle as offered to the Lares, Od. 3. e 3.
and 16. .
4 27. amara, ‘baskets’ in which the offerings of incense, calces,
far, ete, were held. See the description a. 1. 11-14.
