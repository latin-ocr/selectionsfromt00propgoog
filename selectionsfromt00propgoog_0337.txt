270 Norae.

20. Kottis amoma conditione. See note above on1.19.r.
21. subducet, scarcely an appropriate word with flauam ud z
r'nrhr, as it properly implies a silent stealthy withdrawing. Poeaus.
like llorace’s edax, it may apply to the gradnal corrosion and dent ζ
ot damp. But in the passage of Pind. Pyth. b. which properea
seems to have imitated, the corresponding words χειμέριος ὅμβρω
refer to a sudden storm.
23. emortum again suggests the mperbtizm Quam
meritis ol Hor. Od. 5. 30. 15.
ab aevo, ‘at the hands os time' or‘ in consequence οἱ] Οῐ
the ab might be instmmental, stronger than aevo alone. Pindet
translates ⁴ shall fall away from time’ or ‘life' ‘From time‘ make
no sense; and aevum does not signify ‘life ⁹ as distinguished hon
‘death' but only ‘a lile-time!
with these last lines cp. Shelley, Adonais:
find hc is guthered to the kings of thought
ll'lro τυφῶ contentiori with their time's dccay.
And of the past are all that cannot pass away.

111. 3.

once more Propertius returns to the theme that Apollo andthe
hluses have forbidden him to sing in heroic verse the glorians
Roman history, and warned him to confine himself to elegiae rene·
So exaetly llor. Od. 4. '15. 1

Phoebus volentem praelia nte loqui
Victus ct turbes increpuit tyra,
Nc parva Tyrrhenum per aequor
Vela darem.

So completely had the examples of Homer and Ennius placed Epic
poetry upon a level above all other, that those who laboured in any
other field felt that they could not make good their claim to be poelt
at all without apology. But it is t0 be marked, that while there isa
truer note os manly medesty in Horace's estimate of his own powers
and his aime, so, in the very act ot seli-depreciation, he has throvn
un undying historica] halo round the very men audacte whose preire
he announces himself unwilling to sing. The hum of the toilsome
bec os hlcunt Matinns has sonnded not less bravely, has ministered
to Fame no less notably, than the note of the Dircaeun swan.

The piece is in the torm of a dream or allegory in which Apollo
wams the poet away from severer studies, and Calliope promises him
inspiration in Elegiae poetry.
