TIBULLUS,1. 7., 28. 143

his murder by Typhon (Set). This myth probably typilies the
struggle of darkness with light, and also of good with evil. In the
same manner the departed human soul was held to follow the Sun in
his course through the nether world and to rise again. One special
function of Osiris is that of Judge of the Dead: a function appa-
rently assigned to no other deity. He frequently appears in this
capacity in representations of Hades; he is swathed as a mummy,
and beside him is his minister Anubis, with the face of a dog or
juchal, who assists in laying out the dead, etc.

Isis again aflords an instance of the sels-dividing process of the
une original power in the matter of sex, as into active and passive. Just
as several male gods may be fused into one, so Isis becomes Athor,
Neith, Bast, etc. And the male power himself, becomiug ἀρσενό-
liius, is styled both ‘father of fathers‚' and also ‘mother of mothers,'
the stronger sex absorbing the properties of both. Osiris. too, as
prinal spirit, being identified with primal matter, becomes the water
which is the womb of the world, and hence passes on to be the Nile
01 even the Ocean. It is obvious that this quasi-Hegelian process

. may account to some extent for the different accounts given by Greek

· authors of Osiris and other Egyptian deities.

i The river Nile was worshipped both in his own right, and also
uepresenting Osiris. Hymns addressed to the Nile have been found:
md Brugsch gives an inscription from a sarcophagus, on which the
stur gods, representing the four elements, who bestowed favours on
thedeparted, are thus enumerated:

Ra, he gives thee light.

Su, he gives thee sancet brath of air.

er (or Seb, the Earth), he gives thee all growing fruits.

Osiris, ke gives thee the Nile, thou lz'vcst again.

The two aspects of the Nile-the earthly and the heavenly-give
aiunher illustration of the transforming tendency of Egyptian
mythology. For as the earthly Nile is often named Nun or Oceanus,
itone inscription he is styled ‘Ocean-Nile (Nun-Hirpi), Father of
heines! So too the heavenly stream assumes sometimes the name
Hip or Hirpi, which was the Egyptian title for the earthly river ¹.
