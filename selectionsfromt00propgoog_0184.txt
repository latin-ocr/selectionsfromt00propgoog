ι . 40. ΜΗ. We have seen this word above, l. 8, used in an

¹ active sense,‘that can makeeasity! Here it is used passively, ‘that

*can be easily made or moulded,' ‘ductile’ So Ov. Met. 15. 169
thue naurs facilis sr'grtatur cera figuris.

41. requiro approaches very nearly in meaning to desidem ,
²⁶ ‘to miss,’ ‘to leel regret for the loss oi something once enjoyed;’
²'' and is sometimes coupled with it, as in Cic. Verr. a. 5. 67 cives
Ι Romani vestram, severitatem desiderant, vestrum auxilium rc·
l puimnt. Here desiderantis ‘feel the loss of ;' requirunt, ‘demand
² to have restored to them!
² 42. condite, of the harvest gathered in aud safely‘ stored’ in
' the gamer.

’ 43. lecto . . . toro. ‘Diiserunt enim lectum et torus ut λέχος et
ebriis D. Lectus is the bed as a whole: connected with lex, ligo,
our‘lay,’ etc. Torus connected with στορέννυμι, sterno, stramen,
toral, etc, refers to the cushions or bedding: hence such phrases as
praeierit herba torum, etc. Ov. Her. 5. ¹4·

in Tibullus than in Catullus, though more frequent than in Ovid. · ·

51. The allusion to precious stones has been held to indicate
that the proposed campaign was to be in the East. Propertius in the
same way expects rich booty oi jewels irom Augustus' projected
campaign against the· Parthians, 3. 4. a ; 3. 5. 4, etc.

muudi. ‘It appears extremely probable that the ancients
gave the name smaragdus not merely to the precious gem which
we call an emerald, but extended the term to fluor spar, green
vitrified lava (green Icelandic agate), green jasper, and green glass.
There is a curious passage in Pliny, H. N. 37. 5, where he tells
us that Nero used to view the combats oi gladiators “in an
emerald,’' which is generally understood to mean a smooth polished
mirror made oi some oi the above substances; although, from the
peculiar phraseology employed, others maintain that the emperor

. was near-sighted‚ and used a concave eyeglass formed out oi the

gem. See Beckmann, History of Inventions, vol. 3. p. urfa?
