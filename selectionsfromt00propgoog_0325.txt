Elegiae School‚ a school whose characteristic feature wasa ui
01 000110 with eruditiori. Philetas 01 Cos was the younger«
two; he lived ander the first Ptolemy, by whom 110 was app
to be tutor to his son Philadelphus, and died probably betwee
and 270 110. Callimachus, a member 01 the noble family«
Battiadae 01 Cyrene. was patronised by Philadelphus aud was
librarian 011110 iasnous Alexandriae library (01 which the mair
was bumt during the blockade 01 Julius Caesar) from circi
²40 tte. Resides being a poet, Callimachus was one 01 the
famous grammarians and critica 01 1110 Alexandrina 00110010
poema were a marvel 01 laboured aad affected learning. an
01 his hymns aad epigrams remain ; but 110 was especially dcem
prince 01 elegiae poetry, andin this branch the best idea 01 histor
and enidite style is to be obtained from Catullus' adaptationi
Coma Berenices. Philetas was deemed second to Callimachus
oppressed with learning, he had probably more genuiuel
feeling. His main works were elegles 10 praise 01 his 01
Bittis or Battis. Propertius speaks 01 both with the utmost:
ence as his masters. Besides the passage before us, see 3. 9· 43
Inter Callimachi sat erit placuisse libellos,
Et cecinisse nuder, Coc poeta, tuis.

ln 2. 34. 31-2. whatever reading be adopted, the two poca
placed on a par; but in 3. 3. 514 he derives his inspirator

1. sacra. Postgate is surely wrong 11010. Sacra no dot
used of any ‘sacred things ;' but the explanatione ‘sacred reli
and ‘the disembodied spirit,' are neither consistent 10 them
nor with the passage as a whole. The idea is the samewhit
have had above, 2. 10. 24

admitted a brother 01 the guild. Callimachus and Philetasi
dead, Propertius addresses their Manes ; and using that ι(1101001
ness’ 01 expression which has been illustrated on a. ¹3· 37
’1 Postgate's introduction), he speaks 01 the Manes 01 Callimachu·
