‚occupied a conspicuous place in the history os the internal affairs of
iRome and formed, for a long period, a political engine of great
,power They were originally deposited in a stone chest, under
2groupd, in the temple of Jupiter Capitolinus, and were committed to
{ibe charge os inspectors or commissionem chosen from among the
{patriciana whose duty it was to consult them when authorised by
the Senate. The number oi commissioners was originally two, who
¹,mere styled duumvirisacrorum or duumviri libris adeundis. ln the
[year ne. 368, a bill was brought in by the tribunes to increase the
‘number oi commissioners from two to ten, with the condition that
ure-half of these should be plebeians. After great opposition, the
,bill was carried the following year, and continued in force until the
'dictatorship ol Sulla, by whom the number was further augmented
io fifteen.

preserved either in sanctuaries or by private individuals. In this
manner about a thousand lines were procured and brought to Rome&

commanded that all books of prophecies‚ resting upon no sufficient
huthority, of which upwards ol a thousand were in circulatim,
should be brought together and bumed². Hc then directed his
attention to the Sibylline verses preserved by the State, and took
great pains to separate the genuine from such as were deemed

destroyed this second edition of the Sibylline verses, and all writings
os this description which remained were finally swept away by au
edict oi the emperor Honorius. The compilation now extant under
the name os “Sibyllina Oracula” is well known to be a lorgery.’
