cally in a wide sense at Rome, as it ¹included all citizens
liable to be called on lor military service up to lorty·six
years of age. Thus under the constitution ol Servius
Tullius each Class was divided into an equal number of
Senior Centuries and Junior Centuries: all citizeneup to
the age ol lorty-six were included in the latter. The
language ol poetry, however, was not bound to conform
to such a use as this; and we may fairly assume that
the lact ol an early death would not have been insisted on
hy Domitius had Tibullus been more than lorty when he
died. ⁴ Assuming this point therefore as an extreme limit,
we may assign Β. c. 59 as the earliest possible date lor the
poet's birth, whilst it is not possible lor various reasons to
place it later than lae. 54. The latteris the date assumed by

it is impossible to arrive ata certain conclusion on the sub-

poet’s biography as a whole. lt certainly suits well the
tone ol Horace’s Epistle, in which he treats Tibullus as
an equal to whose criticisms he attaches weight‚ while at
the same time he addresses him in that patronising but
kindly tone which he could only have employed to one
decidedly younger than himself. Horace was horn in

The praenomen of our poet is unknown. He was a
Roman eques, and was probably born at Pedum, a Latin
town just at the foot of the Apennines, and a lew miles
north of Praeneste, where his lather possessed an ample
estate. Hehad been brought up, he tells us (1. 10. 16), on
this estate, and he had looked lorward to inheriting a rich
patrimony ; but his fortunes came under a cloud, and he
· lost either the whole or the greater portion ol it. The
language which he uses upon the subject is not sree from
ambiguity; but it is certain that the losses which he sus·
tained were connected with his landed estate, and that
they were only osa partial character. He still continued
