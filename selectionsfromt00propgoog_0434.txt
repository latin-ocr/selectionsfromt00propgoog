¹ , PROPERTIUS, 1v.11.,67-a5'. 367

ubi, referring to Haec l. 71. The more usual construction
would be ut with the subjunctive=‘namely that! Haec . . . ubi:
‘In these cases, namely where’

74. Hertz. well compares Cic. Verr. 2. ¹·44 Cur hunc dolorem ci·
neri eius atque ossibus inussisti? The confusion of metaphor is natural,
but glaring ; inusta must refer to branding, as eduma in 3. 11. 40

Una Philippeo sanguine adusta nota,
the idea being suggested by cineri. ‘To brand upon ashes’ would
be absurd: but the absurdity is relieved by the ancient idea that the
ashes of the dead still live and feel, as in 2. 13. 42

Non nihil ad verum conscia terra sapit.
To suppose that spirat refers to the quivering flame (‘ = (fif Postgate)
seems farfetched, and introduces the new incongruity of the flame
being itself branded or bumt in.

72-102. Au exquisite passage; full of simple feeling, true to
human nature, and breathing a tenderness and delicacy worthy of
the noblest type of womanhood.

75. maternis vicibus, ‘the part of a mother:’ the plural, as
in Quint. Inst. proem. 4 quando divz'sae professionum vices essent.

80. oscula falla. Fallere aliquid, as we have seen above
4. 4. 20, means ‘to exhibit deceit or treachery about something3’
so here, ‘give a seigned character to thy kisses,' siccis genes, ‘by
(presenting) dry cheeks :' ‘let thy dry cheek disguise the character of
thy kisses,' i. e. he was not to show, by the passionate nature of his
kiss, that there was more in it thau a mere father's affection for his
children. A touch absolutely true to nature. Who has not seen, in
a similar case, the tears for a lost love pouring themselves out upon
the children? The words doubtless might mean ‘Be false to, or
cheat, their kisses by dry eyes (or cheeks)‚’ ie. do not let them see
that you have been weeping, but meet their caresses bya show of
indifference: but few will hesitate to prefer the first interpretation.

81. The nights, as though they were persons, are worn out by
Paullus’ lamentations: cp. Virg. Aen. 8. 94 aud Val. Flac. Aug. 5.
602 Marte diem noctemque fatz'get. Still more strongly Sil. Ital. 12.
496 curasfatagat.

82. tn taniam credita, ‘which you deem to assume my form,’
‘wrought by your fancy into my form!

84. He is not to speak on continuously‚ but to wait after
each verbum sorau auswer.

85. Seu corresponds to seu l. 91. She now tums to her chil-
dren, and prepares them for a double alternative: their father
marrying again, or remaining as he is.
