llere taeda stands ior ‘marriage’ as ln Virg. Aen. 4 18, wherellih
sa s,
y Si non pertaesum thalami taedaeque ficisset.

nam. Postgate seems to mise the force ol this word: ‘ht
argument is, “to pass ou to me,I shall always be true to you¹¹
Surely nam gives the reason io the sudden change oltoneirtu
<luced by scd in l. 17, ⁴ Nay, niter all. I mua pray ior thy htpg
voyage: forI can never give up my love for thee, and onom
thou goest, thou shalt yet be mine!

21. corrumpere. It should be notioed that this word daona
exactly correspond to our word ‘to corrupt? It meant ‘to hul
through‚'‘ to break utterly,' ‘to destroy: aud so to render a thiugue
less forits proper object. To a people who worshipped strength ahor
all things, a word signiiying loss of strength came naturally roure
a moral meaning ; but the ideas associated with it were rather tho!
os loss os fibre, weakness, and luxury, which the Roman moniist
especially connected with loss oi mauly virtue, than what we dem
by moral corruption. Thus Sallust, Jug. 39. 5 milites. . . licenti
atquc lascivia comcperat; Tac. Hiar. 3. 49 dr'sctplt'naru coma·

to ‘so as not:' as here, ‘No marriage shall change me so rial

Ι shall not complain’ Its most usual use is aiter verbs ol daubore:

non dubium cst quin cam viderim means literally‚ ‘No doubt

ι exists so that 1 did not see hcr'=‘No doubt exists which interierat

with. or prevents, my having seen her,' i. e. ‘There is no doubt bul

«that I saw her,' or ‘as to my having seen her.' Quonam has prr·
cisely the same sense alter verbs oi preventing or hindering.

verba querar. As Postgate points out, there is no need to alte

this reading. Verba is the cognate accusative aiter querar, which

is used in the sense of ‘to pour forth by way oi complaint’ Thus

Verba queri is ‘to pour sarth complaining words' or ‘wordsol
