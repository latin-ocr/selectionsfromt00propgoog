only (11. 21. 334) are Notus and Zephyrus conjoined. Thus these
four winde are not regarded as being at right angles to each other:
Boreas is nearer to Zephyrus, Notus is nearer to Eurus.

49. aperto lu coniuge, ‘in the case ol an acknowledged
husband! For in, attached in this sense to a verb os loviug, cp.
Hor. Od. 1. 17. 19 laborantes in una ; id. Epod. 11. 4 in pueris aut
in puellis urere ; and Prop. 1. 14. 7

Perditus in quadam tardis pallescere curis
Incipis.

50. Pinder points out the alliteration of this line.

51. tibi cannot be right here: there is no point in ‘thy purple’
'u' the linebe punctuated naturally as in the text, and to read with
Pinder, Bae, etc. nam milei qua? tibi, etc. is harsh as well as point·
less. Palmer presers ter, and suggests qua . . . qua as a possibility.

52. meas is clearly right. Bae. follows most MSS. in reading
ruas, which can only be interpreted ‘these hands which in very truth are
thine ’-an intolerable ambiguity‚ and not supported by such phrases
as Blanditias meas, ascula mea (‘ kisses, etc, meant sor me ⁹), quoted
from Tib. 1. 9. 77, etc. Coaxings and kissings are transserable‚ hands
ure not.

os crystal by imagining that it contained water fronen into ice. Thus
Claud. Epig. 11

Dum chrystalla puer contingere lubrica gaudet,

Vidit perspicua deprensas marmore lymphas,
Dura quibus salis parcere novit leuues ,·

Et siccum relegens labris sitientibus arbem
Irrita quaesitis oscula figit aquis.
