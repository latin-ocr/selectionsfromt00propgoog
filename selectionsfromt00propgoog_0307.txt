240 NOTES.

Propertius, though he hus sailed to express himself clearly, nenio
convey the idea foundinldosehus a. 17 '
aral πτερόεις ὡς ὄρνις {cinam ἄλλοι ἐπ’ ἄλλᾳ
ἀνέρας ἡδὶ mom, tvl σπλάγχνοις δὲ κάθηται.
Bat here two ideasareconveyed: (1) the god flits hom caepe!

to another, (a) he sits upon the σπλάγχνα, It ie eridmt dale
words lncmono corde volare can mean neither the onerorueala

and what is the meaning ol love sitting upon the oridyyrail
may either be that he takes his station on the beart, as moad
seat and abode; or that he perches there as a bird ol prey, to id
on the vitais of the man, as the eagle on the liver ofPromeia
Postgate quotes line 15 in favour oi his viem bnt the very uuis!
seem to show the true meaning oi tut σπλάγχνοις odom:
Evolat heu! nostro quoniam dc pectore nusquam,
Assiduusquc meo sanguine bella gerit,

i. e. the god never leaves his breast but carries on the war warh
own blood. Postgate's explanation, ‘my blood accompanying,’sefl¹
unmeaning. in lines 5 and ⁶ there isnothing about war, bloods
preying: they simply say that the artist properly represented lar
as fumished with wings, and ‘made him humano corde fly as a μ’
Can these words not mean ‘possessed oi the cor (i. e. the hearttle
feelings, and so almost the personality), of a man, but ilyingrriil
wings as a god? Humano corde would thus be an ablatived
quality. Cor is used, and especially corculum, to denote a persta:
and the position of the words suggests aa antithesis between hum
and deum. In suche connection it is not unnatural to saytta
Love is represented as having a human beart, i. e. as a man, sul
at the same time flying as onlya god can fly. Ii humano cod
be an ablative os place, the only way oi extracting Postgate's mear
ing would be to translate ‘ flies from the human heart,’ i. e. iram tut
to another. Baehrens reads hunuano calce. He probably mest
the allusion to beto the talaria, or small wings attached t0 the hed,
which we see in representations of Cupid aad Mercnry.

7. The idea of flying in air suggests that os floating canant
and falling waves, at the caprice of every wind.

8. nostra, like suus, applied toa wind, naturally suggests thr
idea of ‘favourable' But in itsels‚ as here, ‘our wind’ simply
means ‘the wind which bears us} any further meaning depending
on the context.
