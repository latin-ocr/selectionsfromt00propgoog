INTRODUC Τ 1οΝ TO PROPERTIUS. xxxiii

navita dives eras instead of non ita dives eras in 2. 24.

As to the birthplace of our poet, a lively controversy
hasbeen waged. We know from himself that he was an
Umbrian, but he does not fix the exact locality of his
birth, and there are at least four towns whose claim to
the honour have been supported with a good show of
reason by different editors. These towns are Asisium
(the modern Assisi, lamed as the birthplace of St.
Francis) ; Mevania (Bevagna); Ameria (Amelia); and
Herpellum (Spello), to which may also be added Perusia
“ (Perugia), though that town is not situated in Umbria at
all. Ahnost all recent editors, however, are agreed in fix·
ing upon Aszbium: and yet, if the words of Propertius on
which they rely be taken in their simple sense, nothing
can be more clear than the fact that, while indicating each
of the above-named places in connection with his birth,
he does not state that he was born in any one of them.
On the contrary, his references to the different cities show
that his birthplace might be described in connection with
them all; and that he was in all probability born in some
country house or village situated in the district which lay
between them. The passages which bear on the subject
are the following :— '

1. The poem 1. 22 is written for the express purpose of
answering the inquiries of his friend Tullus as to his
horne and family:

Qgealis et unde genus, qui sint ntihe', Tulle, Penates,
Quaem’s pro nostra semper amicitia.

‘Thou art ever asking, Tullus, as an old friend, what
and whence my racc, what my home!

Propertius answers by referring him to the town of
Perusia, and adds, 11. 9, 10

Proximis subposito contingens Umbria campo
Me genuit, terris fertilis uberibus;
