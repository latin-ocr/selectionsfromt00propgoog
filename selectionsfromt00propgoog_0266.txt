PROPERTIUS, Ι. 14., t·19· 199

0 Chloris, theudori imitate thyself,

Seis-imilating passati μετέστω stenes ‚⁴

For all tite Eastern-Indian golden pelf,

Thy red and white witi truest fair aiones.
IIow sar removed is the elaborate ‘conceit' of the modern poet
from the simplieity and directness oi Propertius!

13. ‘Assure me that kings will yield to me,' i. e. in point of
happiness,

13,14. There is much in this poem, as well us in poems 8, 17,

and 18, which remind us of passages in Shakespeare's Sonnets.

ζ Cp. Sonnets ²5 and 29, which ends with the lines
For thy swect love remembered sucis wealtlz brings,
T hat then I scorn to change my state with kings.
·.· Cp. lines ²3· ²4· But every comparison only brings out more clearly
the essentia] differences between the ancient and modern conceptions
of love. How unintelligible to Propertius would have been the
spirit of Scott’s well-known lines, though they reproduce the main
idea of ll. 17-24:

In peace Iove tunes tie shepkerd‘s ried,

In war hc mounts tire enarrabis stecd,

In halis, in gay aitire is seen,

In lamlcts, dances on ilie green. ,

Leve rules ilie castrt, the camp, the grove,

For love is lrleavcn, aad Heaven is love.

15. adverso . . . Amore. ‘Is Love be unpropitious.' Hertz-
berg quotes Mimnermus:

Τίς δὲ βίος, τίδὲ τερπνόν, ἄτερ χρυσῆς Ἀφροδίτης ;
τεθναίην ὅτε μοι μηκέτι ταῦτα μέλοι.

16. siut, conditional, ‘No wealth would be wealth to me?

trini, of a maiden who will not smile on her lover: so Prop.
1. 6. 10, and Tib. 4. 4, 17

lacrimis erit aptius uti
Si quando fucrit tristior illa tibi.

17-22. ‘Not strength or stemness, not wealth or luxury, can
keep Love away)

18. dolor. The nominative, es elsewhere iu Propertius, is here
put sor the more usual dative of predication. See 1. 18. 15 and the '
passages referred to in the Index.

19. Arubium timon, i. e. a threshold paved with onyx, or
Orientai alabaster, which was brought from Arabia (Plin. N. H. 36.
12) and wus much used for cups, pillars, and other ornamental work
at Rome.
