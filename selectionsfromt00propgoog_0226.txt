TIBULLUS‚ 11. 1.‚ 2-25. 159

Ι The neuter seems to have the same sense as in the Psalm:
‘Let everything that hath breath praise the Iord? .
w- * rio'n for ne in prohibitive sentenoes has a gentle dissuasive
μ’ meaning, amounting rather to a recommendation than an order:

Hor. Sat. 2. 5. 91

Drfficr'lem ct morosam offlndct garrulus ultro·

Naar etiam sileas: Ι
‘you should rust keep silence? Pers. 1. 5

non, si quid turbida Rama

Elevea accedas.
Other instanoes are Hor. Ep. 1. 18. 72, A. P. 460. In these pas·
suges the prohibitive meaning shades nearly off into the conditional:
‘you would not keep silence,’ i. e. if you followed my advice.

15. eat. The lamb was sacrificed aster having been led thrice
round the farm: Festus says, Ambarralis hostia cst quae rei diuinae
causa circum arua ducitur ab iis qui pro frugibus faciunt. So
Virg. Geo. r. 345 ¹ ι Ι ² aaa&

Terque navas curcum felix eat kastra fruges. Π

19. aen seges eludet messem. The harvest or crop itself
is said to be mocked with vain hopes, in place ol the husbandman.
Hor. 3. 16. 30 expresses exactly the same idea by et segetis certa
fides uuae, as though the crop had given a promise which it loyally
redeemed. Cp. Virg. Geo.1 2²5· The herbae are the green blades

which never come to my Ov. Her. 17. 263 puts the idea into
aproverb, {stu 4*ΐῖ M mia ' ¹ ¹

Sed nimium properas et adhuc tua messis in herba est. ε . a ··
21. nitidus, ‘spruce τ’ Hor. Epp. 1. 4. 15. ’
23. The master, having feasted royally, is in a good temper,
feeds his slaves from his table, and looks kindly on their sports.
Cp. Hor. Od. 3. 17. 16 cum sareulis spamam solutas, and Epp. 2. 1.
ψ Cum sociis operum, pueris et coniuge fida.
24„ The allusion seems to be to extempore arbours put up by the
slaves near the altar, in which to drink and be merry. The names
pergula, trichila were given to them: they are described in Ov.
F ast. 3. 527
Sub Iove pars durat: pauci tentoria ponunt:
Sunt quibus tramis frondea facta casa cst ;
Pars sibi pro rigidis calamos statuere columnis,
Desuper extentas inposuere togas.
See Tib. 2. 5. 97.
25. meatum, i. e. ‘prayers that will be iulfilled?
