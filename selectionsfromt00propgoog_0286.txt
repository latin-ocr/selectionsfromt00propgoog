PROPERTJUS‚11.1.‚ 27-33. 219

Clodius, tac. 58 ; Antony presented it to the children of Cleopatra;
and after the battle of Actium it becarm an imperatorial province. Its
fate therefore might well be mentioned separately from that of Egypt.
cum traam. N. has curn attractus, others contractus or con·
tactus, from which Palmer and Baehrens have both independently
conjectured atratus. With that reading the idea would be that the
Nile was in mourning when representations of himself and his seven
mouths were borne along in the triumph of Octavianus. Prop.
3. 5. 34 affords an excellent illustrarim, both as to sense and reading.
The Sun’s horses in eclipse are represented as being in mouming:
Solis et atgatis luxerit orbis equis ; ,
and there, as here, atratis has been changedin Gron. to attractis,
in Per. to attractis. With atratus, urbe should be read. That
pictures of rivers were carried along in triumphs is well known:
thus Pers. 6. 47
ingentesque locat Caesonia Rhenus.

So Ovid, Art. 1. 223, where the Tigris and Euphrates are pointed out
. as part of a triumphal show. More to the point is Virg. Aen. 8. 711,
where the Nile himself is represented on the shield of Aeneas as
grieving at the defeat of Cleopatra, and in immediate connection
with Caesar’s triple triumph:

Contra autem magna maerentem corpore Nilum,

Pandenteenque nnus, et tata veste vacantem

Caeruleum in gremium latebrosaque flumina victas.

If we read tractus in urbem the idea will be that of the Nile
brought in triumph from Egypt to Rome, which is merged l. 32
in the more natural idea of the great seven-mouthed river flowing
weak through sorrow.

32. Marlr the stately but snbdned cadence of this line, so fitting
to the sense. The very division into seven seems to proclaim the loss
of power and glory to the river, as though a victim to the maxim
Divide et impera. The idea of ‘the Nile enchained and dragged to
Rome as a captive wita its seven neautbs' scarcely deserves the epithet
‘happy’ given to it by Paley.

33. As a Roman could never be supposed to conquer, or obtain
a triumph over, Romans, the triumph was ostensibly held over the
native princes who had befriended Antony, such as Philadelphus.
king of Paphlagonia, Amyntas of Pisidia, Deiotarus of Galatia. In
the same way Caesarin nc. 46 did not triumph over Pompey, Scipio,
or Cato, but over Pharnaces and Juba.

These lines are an exact counterpart to Hor. Od. 4. 3. 6, where it
is said of the poet
