Phil. Journal, xv. p. 13, quotes in illustration of this line Lucian de
, Mercede Conductis 58 ἓν γάρ τι καὶ τοῦτο τῶν ἄλλων καλλωπισμάτων

23. Num. The Non of N. has been unnecessarily changed to
' Num by the editors. linum be read, it must be interpretedassuid
playfully or ironically, so as to be equivalent in meaning to nvn or
nonne, just as we might say ‘Is it true thenl' where the implica·

Candidus, a certain correction for ardidus. Candzdus implies
beauty as a whole: candida Dido Virg. Aen. 5. 571. So of Maia,
id. 8. 138, and of Apollo, Hor. Od. 1. a. 31

Elegy marks the commencemcnt of a new book. The poem reads

has determined to give up the writing of love verses, and to betake
himself henceforth to singing of wars and warlike deeds, or, in other
words, to add one more to the panegyrists of Augustus. In his own

Unfortunately the promise is not fulfilled3 ior, as Postgate observes
there is but one poem in the book (a. 51 according to the usual
numbering, on the dedication of the Temple of Apollo), which
specially relates to Augustus, and that poem was obviously written,

quite breaks down; it is not supported by any evidence to show
that a common purpose can be traced running through any one of
the books oi our poet 3 it is opposed by the authority of'the MSS,
and it assigns to the second boolr a bulk so small—nine poems in all
-as to be out of all proportion with the length of the remaining
