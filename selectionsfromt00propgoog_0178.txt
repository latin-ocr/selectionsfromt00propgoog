. and to early Greek mythology. The main seat os his worship was

Lampsacus, on the Hellespont, where he was worshipped as the

son of Dionysus and Aphrodite. He was regarded as the protector

duce, which he protected from thieves and birds, being thus the

ancestor oi the modern scare-crow or ‘tatic-bogle.' His statue was

‘The Lares Privati, or Dourestici, or Familiares, were tutelary
