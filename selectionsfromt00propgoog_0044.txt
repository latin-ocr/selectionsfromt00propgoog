occaso(
Now Pliny the younger, Epist. 6. 15. 1, speaks ol a Pas·
sennus Paullus as a learned eques and a poet, adding,
Gentilicium leuc illi: est em'm municeps Properti atque
etr'am inter maiores suos Propertium narrat. There is
no evidence that Propertius left any child behind him3
³ the words ol Pliny do not necessarily mean more than that
Passennus counted Propertius as belonging to a previous
generation of his family3 and even if they do mean more,
the claim of Passennus to be descended lrom Propertius
as an ancestor is no more prool of the fact than the
similar claim ol the emperor Tacitus to be descended
from the historian. N evertheless‚ the statement of Pliny,
taken along with the inscription, raises a strong proba·
bility that the Propertii were connected with Asisium, and
that Asisium was the nearest important town to the

property on which the poet was born.

The Propertii, it would appear, were a respectable
family in comfortable circumstances, but neither patrician,

noble, nor wealthy. Thus, in his childhood, Propertius
wore the golden bulla that was the sign of ingenuitas,

4. 1. 131
Mox ubi bulla rudi dimissa est aurea collo,
Matris et arete deos libera sumpta toga ;

‘Soon, when I laid aside the golden boss from my
neck, yet unfledged, and assumed the manly gown before
my mother's gods,’

i. e. the PenateS, so·called because his father was dead.
Again, 2. 24. 36, he represents Cynthia as addressing him
thus :

Certus cras, eheu! quamvis nec sanguine avito
Nobilis, et quamvis nm itu dives erar.
