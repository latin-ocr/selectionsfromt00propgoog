PROPERTIUS,111. 7., 51-64· 301

57-64. This last dying speech affords a striking example of
the artificiality of ancient poetry‚ aud especially of that of the Alex-
andrine school. To a modern ear such a speech, in the mouth of a
drowuing man, choked with salt water, would be absurd: but it
must be remembered that speeches were an essential part of the

rtock in trade of an ancient writer, whether of history or poetry.
Such speeches are not intended to represent what any actual person
ever said, or was supposed to have said; they merely sum up, in a¹
pictorial way, the view of the situation taken by the author, or that
which be supposes to have been taken by a bystander.

57. The gods of ὼε Aegean are the vinds: Horace calls Natus
ὼε arbitcrHadn'aa Od. 1. 3. 15 and Auster the Dux inquieti turbidus
Hadriae 3. 3. 53 but that is not the same as calling them gods. Nor
does Virg. Aen. 1. 52 sqq. assign to Aeolus any domiuion over the
sea, but only over the wiuds and storms.

58. degravat, ‘weighs down,’ ‘siuks'

59. miseros primae lanuginis annoa=ma misarum in p. l.
aetate. So nostram vitam for me3.11.1. Postgate refers to the
imitation in Ov. Her. 15. 85.

60. longemanum, of the delicate tapering hands of a boy.
A long hand was admired, Prop. a. 2. 5.

61. alcyonum scopulis, ie. ‘rocks hauuted by halcyons,' and
cousequentlywild and rugged. ’

62. fuscina (furca l) athree- (or four-) pronged spear (τρίαινα),
used by fishermen for spcaring fish, and given as an attribute to
Neptune. It was used as a weapon by the gladiator called retiarius,
who first endeavoured to entangle his adversary with his net, and
then attacked him with the fuscina. Cp. Juv. 2. 143 and Hom.
Od 5. ²92·

63. avehat. So the MSS.: ‘throw me ashore at ς’ not very
satisfactory. Advalzat has been proposed. But Postgate quotes Ov.
Her. 18. 197, where Leander, before crossing ὼε Hellespont, says

Optabo tamen ut partes expellar in illas.
Eveho is frequently used of passengers by sea, as Liv. 37. 15 placuit
tamen Regillum classa tata evehi adportum Ephesi.

64. da rna, to be taken closely with hac: ‘this remnaut of me‚'
‘tineae remains of miue‚’ ‘will be enough, if only,’ etc.

With the idea of this line compare Lycidas:

Ay mel wlzilrt thee tlte shores, and smanding scas
Waslr far away, witere'er thy lanas are hurl‘d,
erctlm beyond tlte stamny Hebrides,

Wm ileu perhaps undar the whelmiug tide
