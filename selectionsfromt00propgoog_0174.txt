‚ arnamar, 1. i., 1-4. 107

Nec tamen invisa pectus milri carpitur aura,
Nec bibit egemma divite nostra sitis ;

Nec miti mille iugis Campania pinguis aratur,
Nec nitier aera para clade, Corinthi, tua.

sibi congerat, ‘pile up for himself.’ Divitis· includes all forms
i wealth, fulvo auro is one of the means by which it may be accu-
mlated. The two main forms are distinguished, Hor. Sat. 2. 1. 15Ι .

2. teneat, ‘have and hold' The word avoids all awkward ques· '¹
ons as to how possession is to be obtained.

culti, ‘land fully tilled,’ and therefore necessarily gained by
tpropdation.

muta, Α, has magna: asimilar mistake occurs Ov. Am. 3. 15. 12
here P. (Palatinus primus) reads campi iugera parva for pauca.
ut Hor. Sat. 1. 6. 4 has magnas legionibus ; so Sallust, Cat. 53.
agera magna might therefore - ‘whole acres? The Roman.
agarum contained two actus quadrati, and the actus quadratus was

square whose side was one hundred Roman feet. Hence a
agarum = a rectangular plot of ground ²40 feet by rao. The
'nglish acre represents a square whose sides are nearly ²09 feet, and
>ntains 43,560 square feet. By reducing Roman feet to English
he Roman foot equals about 11·64 inches imperial measure), it
ill be found that the Roman iugerum contained 272097 square
et, and so was less thau two-thirds of the English acre.

The line is obviously imitated by Ov. Fast. 3. ¹9²

iugeraque inculti pauca tenera sali.

3. labor asiduus, here used oi the hardships and dangers
³ a soldier’s life. So Caesar B. G. 7. 41 of an attack on his camp
istros assidua labare defatigarent. Hor. Epod. 1. 15 alluding (as
ere Tibull.) to the Actiau campaign

in alius 1. 1. Quem has thus a consecutive foroe,=‘one of such
kind as.’

4. dlmuoa The history of the word cassiam is remarkable.
is here used to denote ‘a trumpet,‘ as in Virg. Geo. 2. 539

Necdum etiam audierant instari classica.
s proper meaning is ‘a military signal,’ a signal given to the
{lasses’ into which the Roman people were divided for military
