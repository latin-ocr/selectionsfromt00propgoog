and preserve my maiden purity.’ in other words, she iswilling to
risle her future position as priestess on the truth of her statements.
Preeisely similar is our own form ol oath, ‘So help me God3' before
which comes the promise, ‘I speeie, or will speak, the truth' In
other words, ‘I am willing to rest all my hopes of help irom God
upon the truth os my statements.’ Sometimes, instead os a de-
claratory indicative, as here vera caua, we have ut before the in·
dicative, as ut vcra cana. The meaning would still be the same:
‘as Ι tell,’ ‘as surely as Ι tell,’ ‘in proportion as I tell, the truth, so,
on that condition, may such and such a thing happen to me.’ An
excellent instance os this is Catull. 45. 13-16

1353 Hor. Od. 1. 3. 1, 73 ib. 1. 28. 23, ιγ, and below 1. 121. In all
cases alike sic goes with an optative verb. We may thus typiiy in
a simple form the three possible constmctions:
(1) Vera diuo: sic felix sim;
(ι) Ut vera dico, sic felix sim ,·
i. e. ‘may my future happiness depend upon the truth os what 1
say.’
(3) Dic milii vera: sic salix sis ,·
i. e. ‘Tell me the truth, and may your sature happiness depend
upon your telling it'
