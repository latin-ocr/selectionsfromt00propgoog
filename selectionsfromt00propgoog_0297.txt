where miserae puellae is the reading oi N. (Tyrrell, Hermatheuad

The only objection to this natural construction is that Propulit
usually uses the Greek form of genitive and accusative in ereetum
of the first declension‚ such as Antigones, Persephones, Helm
ete. But there are excepimus, as Helenae 3. 8. 32‚Hermionae1.4i
Antiopae 1. 4. 5, Ariadna sup. 18, and probably Achilli 411.ss
which are enough to break the rule (see Hertz. Qu. P. 164).
