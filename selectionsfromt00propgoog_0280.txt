‘the casting forth of my friend's body was a thing thou didst endure,’
ie. as an indignity. This seems better than to suppose esse omitted.

It would appear from this poem that Maecenas had been exerting
lris influence with his protege, Propertius, to induce him to employ
his muse in the service of Augustus and his „govemment It has
