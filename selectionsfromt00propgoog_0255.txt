11-20. Propertius first prays that his prayer may be hamund
that Cynthia may not be able to sail ; then, imagining her ship auleti
he hopes that the winds which have not deterred her may still nge
around her, while he, stupetied with grief, rates her for her uadi!
from the shore. Then repenting of his crnel words, he hopes thu
after all she may have a prosperous passage. Postgate follows thar
editors who invert the order of the two distichs 11. 1346, partly to '
give tales a better meaning, partly to assist a supposed symmetria!
division of the poem into passages of 4, 4, 6, 6, 6 lines respectirelh ¹
each giving a complete thought. But the change is unneceseary,for
(1) talea has a good sense as given above, referring to the fieroead
stormy winds which he has hoped may prevent her from saiiing alto
gether. These winds he hopes, in his anger, may still continuerint
she has set sail, and that she may have the further agony of seeing
and hearing him upbraiding her from the shore. (a) Atqu m
will thus have its natural sense, instead of ‘And yet' as required by
Postgate's order. (3) Symmetrical divisions should be regarded with
mach suspicion. They may be multiplied indefinitely to suit the
caprice of editors, and once the principle of transposition iaadmittetl
it cannot be kept within reasonable limits. An examination oi the
transpositions suggested in Propertius by recent editors, with the
reasons for thern, will convince a sober critic that his safest courseis
to take and explain the order as he finds it in the best MSS, rather
than to expend ingenuity in showing how our poet might hare bem
more symmetrical or logical in his arrangement. The English head·
ings given in this edition will, it is hoped, serve to bring out that the

order of the MSS. is in almost every case natural and inteliigihltt
and in this case there are no corresponding divisions in the word
part of the Ode.
