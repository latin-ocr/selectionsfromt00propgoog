3. 2‘2 the poet writes to him upbraiding him with his long absence, as
² showing indifference to his friends and the beauties of his own

Ξ country. The First Elegy oi the First Book, in which Propertius ·

ί declares his absolute devotion to Cynthia, is also addressed to Tullus:
2 and it is highly probable that it was through Tullus that the poet
first obtained an introduction to Maecenas.

1. τι, in antithesis to meo anron' in l. 7.

abiectus. This word usually carries with it the idea oidespond-
ι ency or mearmess, as in its English equivalent; but here it is to be
ι· taken simply in the sense oi ‘stretched at ease,' ‘ lying prostrate,' in
ς connection with the local ablative Tiberina unda. Cp. Ov. Her.
’, 7. 1 of the swan who sings upon the Maeander, udis obiectus in

a light, weak wine, of no particular pretensions.

Mentoreo. Mentor was the most celebrated chaser ol silver
among the Greeks, especially famous for his cups. He lived shortly
before 356 ue, as we are told that many of his cups were destroyed
in the buming of the temple ol Ephesus in that year. Enonnous '
prices were paid for his works: Juvenal 8. 104 describes the wealthy
days os the East by asserting

rarae sine Mentore mensae ;
and Martial 4. 39. 5 thus addresses a wealthy connoisseur:
Solus Mentoreos habes labores.
Propertius characterises Mentor's work by the complicated character
osiris subjecte, 3. 9.13
Argumenta magis ruent Motore's addito formae.

3, 4. Tullus lies lazily stretched upon the river bank, watching
the barges gliding down the ’current or being towed against it.

5. intendat vertice silvam This phrase has been strangely
