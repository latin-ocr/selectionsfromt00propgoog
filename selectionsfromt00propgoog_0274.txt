PROPERTIUS, 1. 19·‚ 2·8. 207

clung to them so firmly that it was inconceivable that he should
;'. leave him when dead, and allow his remains to be neglected by her
-2 whom he had loved, is a' perlectly natural and beautiful idea. The
-.ῑ idea ol the Anthology is quite different. There Venus, or the
ministers ol Venus, anoint their eyes with bird-lime that they may
· catch the lover; here Love has fastened himself so firmly on to the
. lover·’s eyes, that he cannot be lorgotten by love, even after death.
ς The old song says
Leve in her eyes sits playing;
3' Shakespeare thinks it necessary to controvert the common opinion,
,ι when he says,
¹ Leve looks not wille the eyes but with tlte mz'eul. '

6. oblito, generally taken in a passive sense, asin Virg. E. 9.
53 Nunc oblita mihi tot carmina. So also Val. Flac. 2. 38. 8.
But is this necessary? Could it not be taken in aquasi-proleptic
sense, to mean ‘ Love has not clung so lightly to my eyes that my
ashes can be left untended bya lorgettiug love.’ L. 3 shows that
; the amore is not his love lor her, but hers for him; it is her forget·
; fulness ol him which he dreads. Thus oblito anem vacet means
2 ‘shall lie unhonoured by a love—a love that has lorgotten me'
r In other words, there is a double predication combined in one ex-
= pressiori. He might either have said ‘that my ashes should be

unhonoured by Love,’ or that ‘Love should be lorgetful ol my ,

‚ ashes.⁸ Here both phrases are welded into one. Moorc brings out
ς· this meaning:

Teo well I've looea', teo hemely, that my bier

Shmeld be unhonoured by a single tear.

Ξ Pinder’s explanation ‘Not even in death will thy love be for·
,ς gotten by me' misses the point. Is it possible that vacet may be
ς used absolutely, ‘lack the honour due to it,' as uncultivated lands
: are said vacare? Oblita amore would then be the ablative absolute,
: ‘my love forgetting‚' ‘through the lorgetsulness of my love.' Cp.

4⁸ 11. 94 Caelibis ad curas nec vacet ulla via.

7. auricomos. Protesilaus is meant, whose father Iphiclus
was son ol Phylacus. The love of Protesilaus for Laodamia is
well-known from Ov. Her. 13. He obtained leave from the gods
to retum to see her lor a single day.

8. caecis in tonia. These words take up and expand the Illic
ol l. 7 by a kind ol appositiou‚ and contrast fiuely with innuantur.
