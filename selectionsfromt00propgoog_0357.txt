Movit Aiacem Telamone natum
Forma captivae dominum Tecmessae.

8. natat. The verb natare, though applied to the oatnrl
swimming of men, fish, or other auimals, is scarcely ever used ofthe
natural floating of ships. It constantly denotes wreckage of wne
sort, as 4. 1. 116

Et natat exuviis Graecia pressa meh.
So Ithacum lasere natantem Juv. 10. 2 57 and Prop. 3. 12. 3²
Totque ht'etnis noctes totque natasse dz'es,
in both of which passages the idea is that Ulysses was floundeiiog
about, with nothing but his swimming powers to trost to. Evae
a ship in harbour the word denotes a wreck in Prop. 2. ²5· ²4
Cum saepe in partu fracta carina natet.

Metaphorically, the word is always used in malam partem ,· asoi
inundations, of eyes swimming in death or drunkenness, of awaverhg
mind, Hor. Sat. 2. 7. 6, of an ill-fitting shoe Ov. A. A. 1. 516, where
it is joined with vagus, a word of kindred meaning. To the Romu
mind, whatever departed from the steady, the solid, the strong, the
straight, was bad.

9. iusta debita, the offices due to the dead, especially that ol
sprinkling earth over the corpse, Hor. Od. 1. 28. 24.

terrae here is ‘the body,' properly ‘the remains when burietl
in earth,' as in 2. 13. 42

Nan nihil acl venem conscia terra sapit.

The epithet piae is transferred to the remains, as all the offiees to
the dead have the character of pietas. Postgate's reference to pien-
tissimus 0n an inscription is scarcely in point. To take terrae with
Paley as a genitive is possible, but inelegant: besides, it is obviously
to be supplied as the object to humare in the next line.

10. pote stands for patei feminine, agreeing with neuter, Petis
and pate are used of all genders, and with both numbers, indifferently.
Cp. 2. 1. 46

Qua pate quisque, in ea coaeterat aete delent.

12. In illustration of this magnificent line-one of the finestio
all ancient poetry-Postgate quotes an epigram from Glaucus {Gk
Anth. 7. 2 35), in which it is said, as here, ofa drowned man, :ta
θάλασσα τάφος. These words, he suggests, may be an echo of the
famous words of Pericles, Thuc. 2. 43, ἀνδρῶν γὰρ ἐπιφανῶν aaroni
τάφος. But no two phrases, similar as they are in meaning, cooldbe ,
more utterly different in sentiment. Pericles meant ‘ Every land isa
monument to our mighty (lead) Propertius means ‘His mother his
no spot to look to as holding the rernains of her dear lost one but
