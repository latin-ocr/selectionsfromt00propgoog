PROPERTJUS, 111. II.‚' 25-36. 309

31. contum is read by N. and should probably be adopted.
‘The price asked oi her abandoned husband,’ ‘the price he had to
pay! Ii coniugii be read, it must bear the same meaning, as=
coniugis. The coniugium was not ioul to her .· the disgrace was not
in her making such a demand, but in his being ready to entertain
it The idea is exaetly the same as that os Florus 4. 11 Haec
mulier Egyptia ab ebrio imperatore pretium libidinum Romanum
imperium petiit. The genitive is a subjective genitive: ‘the price
to be paid by the husband! H. quotes Juv. ra. 62 temporo pros-
pera vectoris, ‘the weather oſs i. e. enjoyed by, the passenger.’

It is worth noting that the Romans laid no blame on Caesar ior
his notorious connection with Cleopatra, which nearly eost him his
lise and reputation in the Alexandrine war. This no doubt was
partly because he roasCaesa13 but mainly because he did not allow
her to be a disturbing clement in his political career. What the
Augustan poets brand as unpardonable in Antony was that he ι
suffered himself to be estranged srom Rome by Egyptian ties, and
attempted to bring the power oi the East to bear upon Rome in war.

32. mutatos. See above on 1. 2.

33. dolis aptissima tellus. The Romans, like most nations,
believed all foreigners to be more treacherous and untruthful than
themselves. They regarded the Greeks as a nation of liars and
flatterers: perfidia plusquam Punica was a proverb with them. The
Greeks shared their estimate of the Egyptians: Pinder quotes Aesch.
