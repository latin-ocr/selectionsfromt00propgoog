350 NOTES.

manu which hasbeen raised in the similar passage, a. r. 66. Itis

very probable that manu is the dative, and that the scribe bas

changed femineae to feminea from ignorance oi the contracted form
ln u. See note on that passage. N. reads apta, the adoption ol
which makes the dative necessary, and it must be confessed that
apta gives a better meaning than acta. There was nothing specially
shameful in the manner in which Cleopatra hnrled her spear, or in
the fact that she hurled it at all, when once arrayed in arms against ,
’ Rome: what was shamelul and hnmiliating to the Roman feeling
was that a woman should appear in arms against Rome, and herself

take part in the campaign. It was the fact that she bore arms,
that she commanded Romans in a war against Rome, that was in-
tolerable: Hor. Epod. 9. 11-14
⁴ Romanus, eheu! posteri negabitis,
Emancipatus feminas, Ι
Fert vallum et arma miles, et spadonibus

at once strikes terror into the enemy.

For the Propertian use os the present participle cp. simulantem 4.
11. 39, and note also fugiens above, l. 15.

stantem, ‘fixed,’ as Delos had been a floating island until
bound down with chains by Zeus, Virg. Aen. 3. 76.

aa vindice, a very rare nse of the ablative absolute in place
oi the nominative, as it refers to the subject of the sentence. The
justification is in stantem, which has practically the force of a verb
with Delas for its subject. Cp. se iudice Juv. 13. a.

28. turre, ‘had to endnre.'

una, a certain correction: unda gives no sense.
