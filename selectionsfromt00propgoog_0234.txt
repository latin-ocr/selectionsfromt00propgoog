TIBULLUS‚ 11. 5., 3-25. 167

Janus, introduced agriculture, wealth (his wife was called Ops), aud
the civilised arts of life, and settled on the bauks oi the Tiber ou the
height originally called Saturnia, subsequently known as the Capi-
tolium. This account is given in detail by Virgil, Aen. 8. 314 sqq.
aud 355, where Saturnus is represented as coming direct from
· Olympus after his defeat by Jupiter. The one intelligible connec-
tion between the two is that Hesiod, Op. 111, tells us that the
golden age on earth was while Kronos ruled in heaven: au idea
which exactly fitted in with the Italian idea of Saturnus, agod of
a peace and plenty, in whose days war and greed aud wrong were
alike unknown.
11-16. In these lines the sour principal methods os divinatiou
are enumerated: (1) From the flight'oi birds (augurium) ; (a) by
lots (per sortes), see note on Tib. 1. 3.11; (3) by the entrails oi
victims (haruspicina) ; (4) by consulting the Sibylline books.

12. fati goes with quid, rather than with provida.

13. Tiberius, with his strong and hard common sense, wished to
do away with the oracles near the city: sed maiestate Praenestinam
sortium territus destitit Suet. 6 3.

14. lubrice, both literally, of the entrails themselves, aud also
figuratively, of the difficulty of their interpretation.

y 16. Thus the Sibylline answers were expressed in Dactylic

· Hexameters. They were in Greek. ⁴

,W 19. The commentators have no reason ior imagining a response

ξ given to Aeneas before stariing on his wanderings hythe Sibyl of
Erythrae. Obviously Tibullus alludes to the visit to the Cumaean

ι. 21-38 form a long parenthesis on the topic which the Roman
poets dwelt on with peculiar complacency, viz. the appearance pre·

23. formaverat. Probably firmaverat (i. e. with a rampart),
