caphereus or caphereus, the S. E. promontory of Euboea.
ι which the Greek fleet was wrecked coming home from Troy,
lured by false bencons. '

39. triumphales, in the very moment of their triumph.

vague incomplete idea being used in place of a definite one. The

41. paullatim, well explained by Postgate of the ‘gradual

te imperfect is used rhetorically instead of the' pluperfect, for the
ilie of vividuess. Propertius throws himself back to the time of the

stead of by duxe'sset. Had verteret been actually (as it is virtually)

Illa meum extremo clamasset pulvere nomen,
Ut milei non ullo pondere terra feret.

Here sepelissent, donasset, clamasset refer to acts done once for
l, and past irrevocably; staret and poneret to continning states or

:ts, which might have been going on at the moment when the .

‘ords were spoken. See note ou the passage.
