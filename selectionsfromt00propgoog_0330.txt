κ 21, 22. Cp. Keats:
Happy lte raho trusts ·.

T a dear Futurity lis darlingfann,·

Tlusc are the pleasures af tle hard,

But richer far Posterity's award.

23, 24„ The idea is similar to, but not quite the same as, that
Of Hor. Od. 3. ²4· 31, 32 .

Virtutem incolumen adimus
Sublatam ex aculis quaerimus invidi:

22. Bonos. This passage, with its imitationby Ov Am.1.15.40,
· ἢ enough to disprove the dictum that Hortor, especially in the singu· .
h, means necessarily some concrete thing and especially ‘a public
¹·⁰ffroe.' It is here personified as a quality and is equivalent to

Thus Postgate’s explanation is unneoessarily elaborate: ‘ a prospec-

distant past) Pinder is right in translating ‘ The oldness of things
makes them seem greater? Cp. vetustate dilapsum in the Inscrip-

pulsu is not very appropriate to noes, but this kind of oon-
i fusion is precisely in the manner of Propertius. The explanation ol
