NOTES ΟΝ TIBULLUS.

Wssnvi' of war aud danger, the poet declares he has no oure for
alth: he will give up a soldier's life with all its hopes and
nours, and retiring to his humble country estate, will live a life of
tce and simple ease, cultivating his fields and tending his uocis,
l happy till death with the love ol Delia.

Phe introduction of Messalla's name, l. 53, implies that Tibullus
l received an invitation from his patron to accompany him on
me military expedition, from joining in which, as part of the great
n's suite, substantial profit might be looked for. There was no
er way for a young man to push his fortunas, and to lay the
ndation of a good balance athis banker's, thau to attach himself
[he cohors or suite of a provincial governor: and we know with
at furious invective Catullus assails the provincial governor whose
anness (or sense of justice l) permitted his suite to return home
Dty—handed (Cat. 28). What then is the occasion to which the
itation of Messalla refers? It could not have been Messalla’s
tnnand in Aquitania, nor his subsequent mission to the liast, for
>ullus accompanied him on both occasions (see Tib. 1. 3 and 7),
Ῑ we know of no foreign service of Messalla's after the latter
nt. lle must look therefore to some earlier 'employmenn and
We know that Messalla took an important part in theActian cam-

l,gn and commanded a division of the fleet' m the battle itself‚ we
ty with all probability infer that this poem was composed m the ¹
ring of suc 31, on the occasion of the poet’s being invited to take ·
van rn that memorable campaign It will be noted that the allu-

>11s' m the piece itself are more applicable to a campaign in which
uve fighting was expected, than to an ordinary provincial com-

and. Assuming this view to be correct, it is interesting to
>mpure this poem with the 1st Epode of Horace, composed under
fteisely similar circumstances, and on the same occasion Like
ibullus, Horace disclaims all desire to make money out oi ‘nis
