PROPERTJUS,1.8.‚ 12-15. 189

Ι 14 provectas, ‘advanced on their way‚' ‘having set sail,'

used proleptically, so that auferet prouectas=‘bear thy ship away!
The word is usually employed of ‘ getting under'weigh,' as in virg.
Aen. 3. 72 Provehimur pertubat may be used of any amount of
progress achieved‚ however small, as in Aen. 2. 24

Huc se provecti deserto iu litore curduut,

, where it means ‘having launched and sailed a certain distance? In
proselit is often used with langius, in the sense of ‘carried far,' or
‘too far?

rates. Τὴε Plur. seems used poetically, and is not inappro-
priate to the original meaning of the word which Festus, p. 273
(Miller), gives thus: Rates uocantur tigna iuter se colligata quae
per aquam aguntur, quo uocabulo interdum etiam naues ipsae signifi·
cantur. Varro, de L. L. c. 2, suggests a reason for the use of the
Plural: Ratis dieta nauis leuga propter remos quod tu· cum per aquas
sublati suut dextra et sinistra duas partes (Scaliger's corr. for
rates), efficere ue'dentur. So Plin. 3. 5. 9, 5 13 of the Tiber, trabibus
potiusquam ratibus uuabe'le's, which shows that the Plural might be
used of a single structure. The word ratis seems to have been used
by the early writers (Attius and Ennius) for ‘an oar :’ this may have
been its original meaning, and would suit well its connection with
the root ar or ra, whence come oro, ars. arma, remus, reta, etc.
That rates here means Cynthia's vessel only seems more poetical and
natural than to suppose with Postgate that Prop. was thinking of a
crowd of vessels. storm-stayed by the same storm, and all setting sail
together. The interpretation above adopted, by which Cynthia is
supposed to sail in spite of high winds,is inconsistent with that
view.

15. The construction is patiatur nu defixum uocare (se) crudelem:
‘may she endure (to see) me stupefied with grief (and to hear me)
oft call her cruel with outstretched hand! Prof. Palmer would take
patiatur as referring to aura. vacua is added to intensify the sense
of the lover's loneliness and desertion. as in 1. 18. 2. The same word
in a different connection may be used to give a sense of complete
repose‚ or ofa mind untroubled by thought or care. Cp. 3. 17. 11

Semper enim uacuos nox sobria torquet antenus.
defixum, ‘deadened,' ‘stupefied,' is the natural meaning; but
this, as Postgate points out, is inconsistent with infesta vocare manu
in the next line. Why should not defixum have a still simpler mean-
ing, ‘ rooted to the groundi’ The picture would then be of the poet
standing in one spot, helpless to follow, but crying out upon her
cruelty with voice and hand.
