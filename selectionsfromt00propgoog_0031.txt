Pedum, unconscious, it would seem, os the great revolu-
tion taking place around him, and without making any
effort—beyond cultivating the friendship of Horace-
to make his way into that brilliant literary circle which
was repaying the patronage ol the new government

of which relate to the love of a noble lady Sulpicia for
Cerinthus—whethera real or imaginary personage is not
