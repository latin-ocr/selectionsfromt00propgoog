352 voras,

36. ferae. Ihave adopted Palmer's conjecture. Lyrae must
surely be wrong. The expression is very harsh, and un-Propertianin
itself, and if it were possible to strain lyras so asto make it equivalent
to Musae, the answer is that there was no tradition of the Muses having
been alarmed by the Python. Imbelles lyrae has crept in because of
inerme ζγναι of 1. 32, and sere might easily drop out after the vere
of timuere. As Apollo himself was the chief lyrist‚ the poet would
scarcely have represented the lyre especially as quailing before the
Python. This objection is not removed by supposing lyraa=Muuu¹
Still we must not forget Hor. Od. 1. 6. 10

Imbellisque lyrru Musa potens vellat.
37. mundi, emphatic, asin 1. 19. At Actium the fate of the
whole civilised world was to be decided ; just as Rome, in the perwfl
„ of Augustus, was to be suffered to reaeh
Quicunque mundo terminus obstitit,
Hor. Od. 3. 3. 53.

39. iam terra tua est, not strictly true. Angustus had as 502
nowhere defeated Antony by land: and had Antony not followed fbf
ill-starred advice of Cleopatra to decide the event on the sea, he bid

, a splendid army of 100,ooo trained legionaries to bring into the felda

besides countless auxiliaries. Antony is generally represented ⁸⁵
having staked his last chance at Actium; but it would be no 1⁶⁵5 =
true to say the same of Augustus: and had Antony won, his coudll ⁴
poets might well have represented Apollo as saying to him before
the battle, iam terra tua est.

42. ‘Caesar's ship is freighted with a natiou's prayers. A very
modern expression! Postgate. ·

44. non bone, ie. the omen was a disastrous oue, after all.
All Rome and her career has been founded on a delusion.

45. Latinos, an almost certain correction for Latinis, which is
ducto remis. Fluctus needs an epithet: the scandal was theta
royal fleet should venture into Latin waters3 and that too when
Augustus was princeps. (Apollo commits an anachronism here, as
Angustus was not made princeps senatus till Β. c. 28.) Et nimium
remis is not ‘And so ’ (Postgate) : nothing yet has been said to dis-
parage Antony's lieet. The words¹ refer to what precedes from l. 39,
Vince nzari: iam terra tua est, etc. The land is already yonrs:
‚ yon must save your country now by victory at sea. ‘Ay, and their
confidence in their ships is over-great’ comes in quite naturally, fol·
lowed by indignation that they should have been permitted to
approach at all.

49. Guyet's conjecture Centauros is surely right. To take
