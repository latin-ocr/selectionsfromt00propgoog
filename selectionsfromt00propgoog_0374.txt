PROPERTIUS, ΙΙΙ. 11, 19·²4· 307

quo efficitur non ut voluptas ne sit voluptas, sed ut voluptas nor sit
nummum bonum. ' Here no distinction can be drawn between utne
tud ut non, each signifying ⁸ so that not' Our passage is strictly
malogous: statuit urbem ut tolleret opus et ut currus ne possent
stringere latus. This nse of ne as = non iu consecutive propositions
suggests that nc might similarly be used aster utin final propositions, ’
in which case utne would mean ‘iu order that not ' and thus be =
ne alone. This suppositiou at once explains the difficolt passage,
Hor. Sat 2. 1. 37, in vain tortured by commentators:
' liffissus ad hoc pulsis, vetus est ut fama, Sabellis,
Quo ne per vacuum Romano incurreret hostis.

Ne here simply stands sor the negative aster ut final, and quo ne
is= nr, ‘in order that not‘ The whole difficulty is thus removed ;
aud Palmer’s ingenious but unnatural explanation, connecting quo
with vacuum, ‘unguardedlot whom,’ rendered unnecessary. Bentley
quotes the Digest 21. 1. 17. 5 in illustratiou of quo ne: si celandi
causa, quo ne ad dominum reverteretur, fugisset. But the authority
ic late, and the interpretation doubtful: Schiitz punctuates si celandi
causa quo, ne ad dominum reverteretur, fugisset. More to the point
isCic. Fam. 7. a praefinisti quo ne pluris emerem. Palmer says of
'this passage, ‘Itis obvious that quo is governed by pluris! True:
hut quo contains either a final or consecutive meaning=ut eo, aud
therefore ru is used, not nen. So exactly in Liv. 346 quoted by
Roby: cautum erat quo ne plus auri et argenti facti, quo ne plus
sr'gnati auri etaeris, domi haberemus. Here quo is doubtless govemed
hy plus3 but quo nc plus is the exact equivalent of ut eo ne plus or
utne plus co, aud exactly illustrates the point insisted on. Another
illustration is Hor. Sat. 1. r. 40

Nil obstet tibi dum nc sit te ditior alter,

where m does not mean ‘lest’ ‘in order that not,' but is simply
used for non aster dum iu the sense of ‘provided that,’ to which
meaning, asindicating purpose, non would not be appropriate. The
rule might perhaps be formulated iu this way: ‘After ut, signifying
consequence, ne may be used; after ut, or any similar conjonction,
dmoung purpose, ne must be used, in place of non.' Bohn (trans.
p. 90uote) quotes three cases oi ne sor ut non in consecutive clauses,
but none of these are consecutive clauses. They are substantiual
clauses only.

The nec of N. is obviously a correction by one who did not un-
derstand the construction. But sor the Et ol 1. 23 nec would have
beentheproper word to use. Ἰ
