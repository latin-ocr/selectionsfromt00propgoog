the Greek name of the citrus tree (Thacia articulata), to which

wood, 1. 53. “

been copied from, Virg. Aen. 10. 136, os ivory set in a t'rame,
Inclusum buxo aut Oricia terebintho.

The terebinthus is our turpentine trec. Pliny describes the wood as
pliant, durablc, et nigri splendoris, H. N. 13. 12, and says cups were
turned out os it. He includes both the citrus and the terebinthus
among the woods suitable for veneeriug purposes, the others being
box, palm, holly, ilex and elder-root (16. 84).

0rlcta, from Oricum or Oriens, in Illyria, the port of em·
barkation sor Brundusium. See 1. 8. 20, where Postgate says it was
⁴ famous sor box and turpentine wood.' What is the authority for
this statement? Pliny says that the trec grew to a great size in Syria,
but that there was a small shrubby 'variety which grew on Mount
Ida in the Troad, and in Macedonia, 13. 12, while in 16. 30 he says
that, like the cedar and larch, it loves the mountains. In‘ all pro-
bability the terebinth was called Orycian, merely because Orycns was
the port of shipping, just as all Eastem wares were called Syrien,
as Shcrry derives its name from Xeres, and Hambnrg Sherry from
the port of Hamburg.

50. mltum or nst tultum, an undoubted correction for
Et fultum. It is hard to choose between the two: but effultus is
twice used by Virgil.

versicolore pluma is difficult. We can scarcely doubt that
cushions‚ cervicalia, are alluded to, as by Martial 12. 17. 8

Dormit ct in pluma purpureoque toro.

But if the cushions are only stuffed with feathers, why versicolore?
Becker, Gallus p. 288—9, makes out that the plumarii exercised an
art os embroidery with icathers, making ‘ieathcr tapestry’ This
may be so: but Mart. 14. 146 applies the terms cervical and pluma
to the same object, and pluma versicolor might well stand for
‘a parti-coloured leather·cushion‚’ pluma denoting the contente,
versicolor the ornamentation os the case. Versiculor, as Postgate
