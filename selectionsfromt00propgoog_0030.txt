between the composition of elegies 10 and r. The style
certainly bears no trace of any such interval. We can
hardly help suspecting that, with his strong dislike to
arms, Tibullus may have found in the confusions of the
time some means of evading or abridging his term of
military service. Itis hard also to understand how he
could have spent ten ol the hest years of his life in active
campaigning without leaving a single indication of the
fact in his poems: more especially as he has left us an
ample record of his subsequent achievements in the train
of his patron Messalla.

Of that distinguished man-M. Valerius Messalla

53. Not less distinguished in literature than in politics,

to 1. 3): Tibullus again accompanied him, but falling
sick at Corcyra, was left behind, and was unable to
rejoin his patron. lt was during his illness on this
occasion that he composed the despondent but beautiful
poem r. 3. From this time onwards the poet led a life
