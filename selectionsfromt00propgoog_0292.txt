PROPERTIUS,11. 1., 66-73. 225

to a rock on Mount Caucasus, where his liver was incessantly
{ed upon by an eagle.

repleverit. The sense points to the successful performanoe of
tlte hopeless taslr, and therefore the future perfect is the appropriate
tense to use, while the simple future is used in ll. 65, 66, 69 and yo.

71. reposcent. The prefix reis used here, as in many other
words, not to denote restitution, but that the thing is suitable,
natural, or due. Poscent would be a demand which might have no
justification3 reposcent implies a natural, proper, inevitable demand.
⁴when they shall come to ask,’ ‘When in the due course of things
they shall ask,’ etc. Cp. Juv. 3. 202, of the roos,

melles ubi reddunt eva columbae,
because pigeons may be expected to lay their eggs on the roof.
Again, a field is said reddere fructum, not because it gives baclr the
seed put into it, or makes a return, but because ‘it duly yields.'

72. breve ta exiguo. Note the emphasising of the sense by
the juxtaposition of two words of similar meaning. Cp. Hor. Od.
1. 3. 10 and Wickham's note.

73. Α difficult line. The text gives spes, the reading of N,
but 1 believe that pars, the reading of G, should be adopted.
Whether we read spes or pars, the meaning of invidiosa will be
the same, ‘full of the envy of others,' ‘the object of envy,’ i. e. the
word is used objectively, not, as more usual, subjectively, in the sense
of ‘ full of envy towards others? If we read spes, then nestrae must
refer to Propertius himself, who in the phrase nostras s. i. iuventae
styles Maecenas the hope of his youthful fortunes, adding that his
expectatious from Maecenas have made him the object of envy.
Literally the words will mean, ‘Thou envy-attracting hope of my
youth! The phrase is strained and ungainly in itself ; but the idea
also is out of place. The poet has declared that his wouud cannot
be healed, and, anticipating an early death, calls on Maecenas, his
chief boast and pride, in lise and death alike, to linger one moment
at his tomb, and let fall the wordS, ‘Died of unrequited love’
The idea of hope is foreign to the passage. The poet's race is run;
be only begs that the one great pride of his life—his connection with
Maecenas-a connection which has brought envy on him in the
past—may not desert him in death, and that Maecenas may stop to
say one word of sympathy over his grave. Hertzberg and Paley,
reading pars, take nestrae eleventur to signify ‘our Roman youth,'
quoting the well-known phrase princeps iuventutis, applied to the
young Caesam, and Horace's Maecenas equitum deeees. Hertzberg
also laboribusly shows that Maecenas might come under the Roman
