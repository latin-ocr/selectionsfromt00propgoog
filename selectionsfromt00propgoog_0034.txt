TO TIBULL US. xxvii

i.e. he gives to Tibullus the palm for grace and polish,
though some would assign it to Propertius: Ovid is more
free, Gallus is deficient in tendemess. But the most beau·
titul tribute to his merit is the Elegy of Ovid, Am. 3. 9, of
which mention hasbeen already made. It is too long to
transcribe as a whole, but here are the concluding lines :

Si tamen e nabis aliquid nisi naneeu et umbra
Restat, in Elysia ualle Tibullus erit.

Obuius huic venius, hedera iuvenilia cinctus
Tempora, cum Calvo, docte Catulle, tuo ,· ·

Sanguinis atque animae prodige, Galle, tuae.

His comes umbra tuaest. Si qua est mode corporis umbra,
Auxisti numeras, culte Tibulle, pelis:

Ossa quieta, precor, tuta requiescite iu urna,
Et sit huntus cineri nau onerosa tuo.

These lines have been thus gracefully rendered by
Professor N ichol¹ :

Ah! yet, if any part af us remains
But name and shadew, Albius is r'iat deul,·
And thau, Catullus, iu Elysiau plains
With Calvus see the iay crawn his head.

fffalse the charge os amity betrayed,
And aught remains across the Stygrau fland,
Shalt meet him yander with thy happy shade.
Reflned Tibullus! thau art joined to those
Liviug iu calm canununian with the blest ;
In peaceful uin thy quiet bones repese—
May earth lie lightly where thy ashes rest!
