288 NOTES.

1. mo, used thus abruptly, implies surprise, almost runo:-
stance, at a conclusion forced suddenly upon the speaker, and hon
which he seels there is no escape. Thus Hor. Od. 1. 24. 5

Ergo Quintilium perpetuus sopor
I'rget!
Ouid. Trist. 3. 2. 1
Ergo erat iu fatis Scythiam quoque visere nostn's!
In llor. Sat. ι. 5. 101 it is an exclamation which bursts nonu
disappointcd legacy-hunter on the reading of the will:
erga nuuc Dama sodalis
Nusquam est?

Pecunia is here personified and treated as a Deity. Tlt
Romans worshipped, and erected temples to, a whole multituded
abstract qualities, such as Fides, Concordia, Honos, Victoria] ·
tas, Fama, etc. Juvenal sarcastically observes that, as yet, bloueyll
not so worshipped:

etsi, funesta Pecunia, templo
Nondum liabitas, nullas Nummorum ereximus aras,
e't colitur Pax atqrce Fides, Victoria, Vc‘rtrcs,
Quaeque salutato crepitat Concordia nida.
Most MSS. insert es aster vitae, N. omits it.

2. The late ll. A. J. Munro severely handled a translatores
Gray's elegy lor rendering ‘the paths ol glory' by honoris iter, de
claring that the line

Ad tumuli sauses ducit honoris iter

could have no meaning except ‘The path os a public office leadstt
the gorge ol a hillock.' ll'c have seen above on 3. 1. 22 that Hom
may be used in an abstract sense, like our Honour or Glory; de
phrase ncortis iter here is a warrant sor baccaris iter. Immotum
would certainly be condemned by an ordinary corrector οἱ verses:
the epithet properly belongs to mortis, not to iter. And it is almost
hypercritical to say (with Postgatel that edituus is not appropriatete
iter. Adire accrum or periculum mortis is as good Latin as adiu
ad cuorum .· ‘to enter upon the path os death' s a perseetly nathir}
expression, and mortu itcr is analogous to Phasidos viam 1. ro, ri
and caeli iter 2. 1. 20.

3. This line is very modern in its tone, especially in applyiug
an epithet like crudelia to pabula. Paley explains the word by clud
i. e. ‘causing so much bloodshed’ But the idea of bloodshedis
foreign to the poem: note curarum in the next line.

4. eapite is used with reference to the personality ol Pecunia
Caput by i no doubt, and in a proper connection, may mean ne
