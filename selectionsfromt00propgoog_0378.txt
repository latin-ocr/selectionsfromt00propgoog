PROPERTIUS‚ III. ΙΙ., 57-49. 311

uis country, not a century ago, were mobbed in the streets. No
less indignant is Horace, Epod. 9. 16
Interque signa turpe militaria
Sol aspicit compium.
Hence our ‘canopy.' κώνωψ is ‘a gnat.‘

46. 1ura dare, ‘to legislate,’ ‘rule’ The statement of this
line appears to have been literally true: for Dion 50. 5 says that
Cleopatra actually τῶν ‘Populos‘ ἄρχειν ἐλπίσαι, τήν τε εὐχὴν τὴν
μεγίστην ὁπότε τι sputos ποιεῖσθαι, τὸ ἐν τῷ Καπιτωλίῳ δικάσαι.
Doubtless Horace refers to this Od. 1. 37. 6

dum Capitolio
Regina dementes ruinas
Funus et imperio parabat.

, et stamas inter et arma uari. Hertz. gravely insists that
aaran must not be connected with Mari, because there were no
statues of men in the Capitol (except those os the kings and of

‚ Brutus) before the time os Caesar. But his history is as much at
fault as his Latin. It would be impossible to separate statuas
from Mari: and, as a matter os fact, the reference is to the noto-
rious and daring exploit os Caesar during his curule aedileship
lte. 65. Sulla had passed a law forbidding Marius' bust to be
displayed, or any monument to be put up in his honour. Caesar
had already dated (tac. 68) to violate this law by having the image
os Marius paraded at the funeral of his widow Julia‚ Caesar’s aunt.
He now outraged senatorial Rome, and delighted the mob, by
causing the statues oi Marius, with the trophies representing his
Jugunhine and Cimbric triumphs, to be replaced secretly by night
inthe Capitol, Suet. Jul.11; Vell. a. 433 Val. Max. 6. 9. 4.

Palmer conjectures dareta with a point of exclamation at
ille end of the line. In this case ausa, l. 41, is a participle, not the
verb, and the whole passage, 39-46, reads as one sentence. Buta
long passage os this kind, reserving its one principal verb sor eight
lines, is scarcely atter the manner oi Propertius.

48. simili, i. e. ‘with a name like itself,‘ in allusion to the
name Superbus.

49. st . . . fuit. Cp. si versat. ..et trahit sup. 11. 1, 2, si daturus
eras l. 38. Propertius is fond of si withthe indicative. Inthese cases
ri loses almost all its hypothetical force. It on the one hand Proper-
tius ‘presers the potential to the actual‘ (Postgate, Introduction,
p. xl), so on the other he is equally fond of substituting the actual
and the presentior the hypothetical and the remote. Translate,
Ἢ, after all, the rule of a woman had to be endured.'
