PROPERTJUS, 111. 18., 3-11. 317

;· vaguelyto express every degree of evil or misiortune, from the greatest
ε to the slightest‚ by which a person can he lowered or brought down.
,τ Thus it may mean mere mental depreciation, as in Virg. Aen. 11.
; 402 contra premere arma Latini, or, as here, the most overwhelming
ς of misfortunes. Cf. Ov. Ep. ex Pont. 1. 7. 11

Baiae, in spite os its waters, was deemed an unhealthy place, as
appears from Cic. Epp. Div. 9. 12 Gratulor Baiis nostris, siquidem,
miseridia, salubres repentae factae sunt, nisi forte . . . dum tu ades sunt
oblitae sui. Quod quidem si ita est, minime miror caelum et terras
vimsuam, si tibi conveniat, dimittere. Malaria to this day pervadas
the district. Eis evidently refers to the various adverse circumstances .

indicated; the mephitic vapours, the unhealthiness of Baiae, the ’

presence of some hostile god in its waters. Palmertakes this passage
differently: ‘His (sc. undis) pressus in Stygias undas vultum demisit?
maltum demisit in undas The common interpretation that
Marcellus was drowned in Avernus or the Bay of Baiae, is uncalled
for. Vultum demittere is a euphemistic term for dying, sng-
gested by the mention os Styx: ‘sank‚ or was lowered, to the Stygian
waters' Such phrases as demittere Orco Aen, 2. 398, Hor. Od. 1.
28. rr,d. neci id. a. 85, etc, are quite common, and vultum gives
merelya more personal and poetical touch to the same idea, The
idea os drowning may perhaps have been suggested by the beautiful
words in Lycidas, which exactly illustrate vultum demisit in undas,
ι It was merserat and perfidiores bark

Built in tlte eclipse, and rigged witlt curses dark,

10. spiritus tue. There is obviously here a double meaning:
the classical sense of spiritus, ‘inspiring breath,' and so ‘ spirit,’ is
mingled with the idea suggested hythe waters of Avcmus, that the
soul of Marcellus floats like a thin vapour on the water. Thus the
passage gives a kind of anticipation of the later use os the word to
signisy a ghost. Postgate well compares the idea os ‘The Lake of
the Dismal Swamp.' '⁸ .

ll. optima. The word optimus, on inscriptions aud else·
where, of a father or mother or wife, etc, is a stock term of praise,
not denoting any special qualities‚ but merely a recognition that the
natural duties of the relatiouship have been well and duly discharged.
Thus Hor. Sat. 1. 4. 105 pater optimus, ‘my worthy father! Hor.
S, a. 1. 12 pater optime, ‘Good Sir! So in the vulgar phrase
