xxvi INTRODUCTION

Albi, nostrornm sermonum candide iudex,

Quid nune te dicam facere in regione Pedana?
Scribere quad Cassi Parmensis oprescula vineat, ³
An tacitum silvas inter reptare salubres,
Curantem quidquid dignum sapiente bonoque est?
Aba in corpus eras sine pectore: di tibi formam,
Di tibi divitias dederunt artemque fruendi.
Quid voveat dulci nutricula maius alumno,

Qui sapere et fari possitquae sentiat, et cui
Gratia, fama, valetudo contingat abunde,

Et mundns victus, non deficiente crumena?

‘What shall Ι say thou art doing, Albius, in thy region
of Pedum, thou kindly critic of my satires? Art thou
⁸ writing aught to outdo the trifles of Parmese Cassius,
or art thou sauntering silent amongst the healthsul
woods, with thoughts bent on all that is worthy of one
wise and good? No body without soul art thou: the
gods have given to thee beauty, they have given thee
wealth and the knowledge how to enjoy it. What more
could fond nurse pray lor the child she loves, than that
he should have good sense, with power to express what
he feels, good friends, a good name, abundance of good
health‚ a trim but modest home, and a purse that is
never empty ?’
Ovid has frequent references to Tibullus, of whom he
speaks in terms ol the warmest admiration. Thus Am.

1. 15. 27

· Donec erunt agrees arcusque Cupidinis anna,
Discentur numeri, culte Tibulle, tui.

‘So long as fire and bow shall be the Cupid’s weapons,
so long thy numbers, polished Tibullus, shall be learnt!

Quintilian, lnst. Or. 10. 1. 93, says, Elegea qnoque
Graecos provocamus, cuins milti tersus atque eleganspg·
maxime ve'eletnr auctor Tibullus: sunt qni Propertium ¹
malint: Ovidius utraque lascivior, stent durior Gallus,
