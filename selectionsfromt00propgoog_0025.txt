xviii [ΝΤ RODUC T ION

The date of the poet’s death is fixed by the E pigram of
Domitius Marsus, mentioned above : Α

T e quoque Vergtlzb comitem non aequa, T ibullc,
Mors iuvenem campos misit ad Elysias,

Ne soret, aut elegis molles qui fleret amares,
Aut caneret sorti regia bella pede.

‘Thee too, in ,Virgil’s company, Tibullus, unkindly
Death despatched yet young to the Elysian fields, that
there might be none either to sing the tearful elegies of
love, or to tell in brave measure of the wars of kings’

Now Virgil died at Brundusium on the 22nd Sept,
Β. e. 19, and the words of Domitius imply that Tibullus
died at the same time, or at least shortly afterwards.
We may therefore assume that his death took place at
the end of Β. e. 19, or the beginning of Β. e. 18.

As to the date of his birth, however, there is more
uncertainty. In the Third Book of the Elegies, there
occurs the following passage, 5. 17, 18

Natalem nostri primum videm parentes
Quum cecidit sata consul uterque pari.

‘My parents saw my first birthday what time the two
⁵ consuls fell by a common fate!

If this couplet were genuine, it would fix the date of
the poet's birth definitely to tac, 43, when the consuls
Hirtius and Pansa fell before the walls of Modena. But
almost all scholars are now agreed in regarding the
Third Book as not being the work of Tibullus; and,
even were it otherwise, this particular passage must be
regarded as an interpolation for the following reasons :—

(1) The second of the two lines occurs verbatim in Ovid,
Trist. 4. 10. 6, who tells us of his own birth:

Editus hic ego sam ; nec nan, ut tempora amris,
Cum cecidit fato consul uterque pari.

‘Here was I born: and that thou may'st know the time,
it was when, etc.’
