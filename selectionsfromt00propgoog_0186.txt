t·i ·
‚- t'reatise De Romanis Familic's ,· but his fame rested chiefly on his
oratorical efforts, which were characterised by great purity of style
. and neatness of expression, and by a lofty and generous tone, though
considered deficient in strength. Noue of his works have been pre-
, served, with the exception of a few insignificant fragments!

54. Referring to the custom os hanging up upon the door·
posts spoils won from the enemy. So Prop. 3. 9. 26
Atque onerare tuam fixa per arma domum.
See Virg. Aen. 7. 183. ³
56. Roman slaves who acted as janitors were not unirequently
“ chained, like dogs, to their posts. So Ov. Am. r. 6. 1

Ianitor, iudignum! dura religate catena.
57. laus is especially used oi military renown: Prop. 1. 6. ²9

Non ego sum laudr', uon natus uacuus armis.

60. Imitated by Ovid iu his Elegy on Tibullus, Am. 3. 9. 58
Me tenuit moriens deficc'entc manu.

63, 64. torro vincta. This does not mean merely that his
breast is ‘inclosed in,' ‘encased by iron' (Pina), but rather that it
is tight bound, aud therefore hard, because made of iron. ibsswffl'e· ff*
67. manos no medo. Flere ct crines solutos habere cousenta- q
ueum. si uero etiam abscinderet crines Delia et gertus laceraret, aegre?A
ferrent hoc Manes poetae, quibus etiam iu Orco cura Jbrmosoe

Desine, Paulle, mcum laeriuris urgere sepulcrum?

69. tangore in this sense is properly used with an acc. nithe
persons joined together, as Ov. Met. 4. 156
Ut quos serus anaor, quas lcora novissima iunxit)

cp. the word coniux, one joined to another. But it is also used, as

here, with a quasi-cognate acc. os the union formed, in such phrases
as iungere pacem, foedera, amicitiam, or as here amorem ,· cp. Cat.

64 ³7² Quare agite, optatos animis coniungite amores.

72. Is cupiti be read, it should probably be taken as an old
“⁴²³s0rm os the abl. as iu Cat. 66. 1²4· Capite is supported by Plaut.

Merc. a. ι. 34
Tun’ capite cauo amas?

On the other hand, the dat. with au infin. after it is not unex-

certe pensari decet princhoi orbis terranem populo. So Dig. ῃ. ιη. N
