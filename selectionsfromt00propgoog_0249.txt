Tun poet is lying alone 40 Rome, worn with rever, and expetiit

death: he ponrs out his lamentations to his friends who are rin'livz

the hot springs oi Etruria. Protesting the innocence ol hislileht

implores the gods not to let him die in youth, but to prolong hisdtp
to a good old age, and begs his friends to offer sacrifices lor his rt·
covery.

1, 2. ‘Etruria was celebrated in ancient, as it is in modern 111111
forits hot springs. Among the most famous 01 these were the ,44011
Caeretanae, now the Bagai di Sasso, in the neighbourhood ostie
important city 01 Agylla or Caere; the Aquae Pisum 0041 de
Bagai di Pisa, within a few miles of Pisae, the still celebrated fl'su
4140414004 Tauri, now Bagai di 11444οί0, near Centumcellae, tr
Traiani Portus (Civita Veccln'a), etc. The poet gives no hint 01 tle
particular spot he alludes to, but many oi these places are 01004101
0004 the sea, and the proverbial insalubrity of this low-lying 0044101
Tuscany (the Marcmma) in hot weather, will sufficiently explainlltt
meaning os the second line.' Strabo 5.·p. ²27 speaks oi tlte hur
ol the Etruscan waters, and says they were as rnnch freqnmtei
as the more famous waters of Baiae. This confirma the reading
proxima.

3. proxima, the conj. adopted by Hiller sor the rnaxima ol the
MSS, gives a good sense: ‘the Etruscan springs, which neartht
dog-days are not to be approached, but at the present 000000 rank
next to the sacred waters of liniae! For this use osproximaimplyhg
a comparison in point oi merit cp. Ov. Met. 12. 398

Pectoraque artificum laudatis proxima agrees,
‘not inferior to.’ N 0 satisfactory explanation os 010τί4440 has bea
suggested. Scaliger supposes Baiae to stand ior hot springrin
