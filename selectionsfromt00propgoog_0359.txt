shore, or a roeky bott0m; the attaching eable had chafed (dauid
and parted coirent). Nocturnis procellis gives the general cadite
of affairs: it may have been the reason for their mooring, asvtlla
the cause of the disaster. Unable to beat ont against thetid·
they would moor off a lec-shore, as their only chance3 bnt eterit

the rocks being said to be bound instead of the ship, ‘the mooredroela'
