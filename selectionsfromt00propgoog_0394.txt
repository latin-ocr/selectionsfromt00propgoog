PROPERTJUS,111. aa, 10-23. 327

Palmer's conjecture Etsi quei rigui is commended by the inge
nuity oi his explanation: ‘the ue' ol rigui was dropped beiore the
ὑπ’ of visenda, aud tlie scribe built up the remaining reg into angae)
But what did the scribe take erigar to mean? F rather, to bring in
havellers in general (si quoe) is scarcely in harmony with the spirit
ol the passage which is addressed to Tullus alone (tu . . . tuque
teo. . . ipse legas).

16. One editor imagines the Rhesus in the Troad to be intended;
another the Ganges! But the seven-mouthed river can be none
other than the Nile ; cp. Cat. 11. 7

Sive quae septemgeminus celerat
Aequora llsz'lus,
rad Ov. Met. 15. 753
Perque papyriferi septemflua flumina Nili.

Temperare means to ‘mix in due proportion.’ hence ‘to mode·
rare? Propertius here means that the force or volume of the water is
lessened by being divided into seven channels: he expresses this by
saying ‘the water moderates its seven channels.’ Cp. Virg. Geo.
1. 110, of water scatebrisque arentia temperat arva, i. e. ‘moderates
the dryness ol the fields.’ Closely parallel is temperat ira manus
1· rr. There is no ‘mixing’ in the case, as Hertz. supposes: Nilus
denuo semper per vias suas effunditur, novasque aquas prioribus
addit, et has suis miscet.

17. ‘Will yield to the Roman laud,’ i. e. ‘to the marvels of the
Romen land· So Juv. 3. 74 sermo Promptus et Isaeo torrentior, where
⁸ more rushing than Isaeus ’ =‘than the eloquence of Isaeus!

18. Imitated by Ov. A. Α. 1. 56.

19. As Pinder observes, the best commentary on these lines is
vag. Aen. 6. 854

Parcere devictis et debellare superbos.
But it is clear from ll. 27-38 that the words cereneoda noxae refer to
more than Roman mercy. Propertius had the passage in Geo. 2
closely in view: the genial temperate climate, free from extremes,
the absence of noxious beasts, fierce animals, serpents, monsters, and
monstrosis crimes, are all referred to in declaring Italy to be not
commoda nexae.

22. Stemu. See note on 3. 18. 15.

temperat. Just as ln l. 16, tlre river itsels, which supplies the
lotoe of water, is said to moderate its courses, so here the rege which
serves the arm is said to moderate it when it declines to put forth

its full strength.
