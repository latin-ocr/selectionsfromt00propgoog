PROPERTJUS, 11. 1., 34-38. 221

say ‘the body,' as distinguished from the mind or snul. From thus
meaning ‘the physical life' or ‘body,' the word came to be used
specially as a term of endearment, as what is primarily loved, or
at least caressed, is the body, not the mind. Thus in Plautus we
have such phrases as caput carum, sestz'vum, lepidissimum, ridiculum,
’ andinVirg. Aen. 4. 354

Me puerArcanius capitisque iniuria cari.

It thus comes about that while we may sometimes, as above, have
to translate cor by ‘head,’ so we may sometimes render caput by
‘heart,' as in the passage before us. Corum caput is just ‘dear
beart: ’ cp. the Greek φίλον ἦτορ. Other special meanings of caput,
such as capitis poeria, ‘capital punishment‚' caput, ‘the sum of a
Roman citizen's rights: etc, are derived from the sense of ‘life'

37, 38. These lines have been generally misunderstood, and
in consequence the connection of ideas has been made to appear
more abrnpt than it really is. Two cases of famous friendships are
appealed to-that of Theseus and Pirithous, and that of Achilles
and Patroclus. Theseus, king of Athens, proved his friendsbip for
Pirithous, son of Ixion (hence Ixionides), by assisting him in his
mad endeavour to carry off Proserpine from the lower world.
Achilles showed his affection for Patroclus, son of Menoetius (hence
Menoetiades)‚.by the fury with which he avenged his death, and by
giving up for that purpose his anger against the Greeks. Accord-
ing to the common interpretation, these cases are referred to simply
as instances of great friendships, with which Propertius wished to
Ι compare the friendship of Angustus and Maecenas. Thus the two
lines serve to illustrate only 1. 34, and the meaning is, ‘Theseus
in ¹the world below‚’ lit. ‘to those below‚' ‘Achilles in the world
above, call Pirithous and Patroclus as witnesses to their friendship.’
But this rendering breaks the coherence of the passage, aud dis·
connects entirely l. 33 from ll. 37-40, which contain its main idea.
Testatur may mean not only ‘calls to witness‚' ‘summons as
witnesses,' but also ‘bears witness to‚' ‘attests,' as in 3. 7. 21

Sunt Agamemnonias testantia littora curas.
Propertius has just said, ‘ 1 would sing the deeds of Augustus and
thine, Maecenas, his faithful friend, hadI the power) He goes on,
‘Theseus to the world below, Achilles to the world above, bear Ἰ
testimony to their friends Pirithous and Patroclus ; but Callimachus
had not the power to thunder forth the battles of Zeus, nor haveI
the power to tell iu heroic verse the glories of Angustus! Thus the
connection of ideas is complete. No doubt iu naming these heroic
friendships the poet intended also to imply that the friendship ot
Augustus and Maecenas wa's as notable as titensa hut *riis maim
