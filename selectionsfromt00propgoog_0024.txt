INTRODUCTION TO TIBULLUS.

Life os Tibullus.

THE following Biography is prefixed to the MSS. of
Tibullus, and incorporated in the old Editions :-

‘Albius Tibullus, equqs Romanus, insignis forma cultuque
corporis observabilis, ante alios Corvinum Messalam originem
(leg. oratorem) dilexit, cuins et contubernalis Aquitanico bello
militaribus donis donatus est. Hic multorum iudicio [et maxime
Quinctiliani viri in studia [et] litterarum acerrimae licentiae]
principem inter elegiographos obtinet locum. Epistulae quoque
eins amatoriae, quanquam breves, omnino utiles sunt. Obiit
adolescens [tempore Vergilii, ut indicat epigramma infra
scriptum:

T e quoquc Vergilio comitem, &c.’]

Our sources of information for the life of the poet .
Tibullus are of the'most scanty description. Of the
little that we know by far the greater part is derived
from the incidental notices of himself and his doings
which are scattered here and there throughout his writ-
ings. The short Biography transcribed above adds but
little to what he himself tells us, except the fact that he
died young. ln addition, we have an Epigram by
a contemporary, Marsus Domitius, referred to in the
same Biography3 two of the poems of Horace-Odes 1.
33 and Epistles 1. 4-are addressed to a poet Albius,
whom the learned have unanimously identified with the
poet Tibullus3 while there are frequent references to
him in the works of Ovid. Amongst these is the exquisite
elegy upon his death, Am. 3. 9. ’
