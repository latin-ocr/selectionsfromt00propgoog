done to his remains upon his death. The allusion maybe einerto
the directions he has given to Cynthia, above, 1. 19 and a.13.41,4a;
or, as some hold Lycio deo to indicate, to the admission of his voris
into the Palatina Library‚ founded by Augustus, B. c. 28. See r. 31
and introduction.

Propertius asserts his position as a poet in somewhat high-flown len·

close to the poem. Exactly similar is the light playiul ending with
which Horace loves to close his more high-strung Odee.

Paley. But I now feel sure that N.'s reading detinuisse is right.
The correspondence between detinuisse and nestinuisse seems
intentional. Detinuz'sse is applied to the animale, who were chained
to the spot, and kept from going on their ways: aasu'nur'sse
implies effort and resistance of the rivers whose onward course was
