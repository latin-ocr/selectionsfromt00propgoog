aare potest. So Jacob, for the MS. reading flere potest, which A
has neither sense nor grammar in its favour. There has been ac
question of weeping or trouble, but only of life safe, in contrastto
life lost. From= l. 29 the poet has been harping on one theme, thr
dangers of the sea, the safety of the land. Terra pamm l. 313 m
terro l. 343 Ventorum est l. 353 insidians pontuml 373 in mors,
etc. l. 423 contentus verteret l. 433 Penates 1. 453 all carry ort
the same idea, and prepare ns for ⁸ Poor‚ but on dry land, where no
storm can blow.’ Stridorem procellae, l· 47, catches up the sanc
theme. Postgate justly says that the rendering ‘where blowing has
no power' is very harsh: I would add, quite unnatnrel. But when
he adds that ‘where nothing can blow’ is not true, hc adoptsa
standard of truth so strict that it would condemn one-half of the body
of existing poetry‚ and almost all metaphorical or exaggerated ex·
pressions. He proposes sat est for potest, and interprete ‘He vas
poor, it was true, but he was on terra firmo, where freedom fron
missorium (nil flere l) r's enough sood for conterelrnent.¹ Do the words l
italicised contain more tmth than the statement that land, as con-
trasted with the sea, is ‘a place where no wind can blovvi’ And
the very next line tells us that on shore Paetus had not to hest
stridorem procellae. Palmer ingeniously suggests

Pauper: at in terra nil ubi flere potest?
‘Poor‚ Ι grant you: but where on earth is it possible to find no
cause for complainti’ but even ifwe could get over the harshness
of the expression, such a sentiment seems to me neither ancieutin
character nor in keeping with the context.

not the pain of hearing‚’ ⁴ had not to hear.’ Postgate, to be consistent,
has to translate ‘Could not endure to hear,' as though Paetus always
dreaded storms. But if so, why did he go to sea? and what is the
force of the next line, that when on shore (hie) ‘he could not endan
to hurt his hands with cables 't’

hic is emphatic, ‘while he was here at home! The lines
47—50 contrast the comfort of home with the terrors and labours of
the deep; and the point is, not that Paetus was naudus exsut
