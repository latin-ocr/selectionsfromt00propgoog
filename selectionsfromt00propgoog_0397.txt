330 NOTES. .

they chose names of the same number of syllables, and of the sane
metrical quantity, as the originals. Thus Catullus writes of Clddiias
Lisblcl, Horace of Terentii as Licymnlcl. The poem before us is full
of fine feeling and of delicate natural touches, which separate it toto
caclo from the laboured sweetness and faultless artificiality of Ovid's
Heroides. Hertz. puts the date of the composition at nc. 20. Astu
whether Ovid copied Propertius in this style of poetry see note onl 3.

2. cum . . . absis is subordinate to si potes. Ἦ, in spite of your

ui potes. The indicative implies that the sentence is hypo
thetical in form only. There is no doubt about the potes: what
she expresses is astonishment at the fact.

3. tamen is not easy to explain. lt may refer to the supposed
completeness of the manduc: ‘This is my message: yet if it seem
wanting in any part, know that it is my tears that are the canu'

reference to death or suicide. From Ov. A. A. 3. 346 it would seem
that Ovid could not have been the imitator, as he claims originalill
in this kind of poetry:

Iguuium hac aliis ille ccauauit opus.
As Ovid was born in nc, 43, and as the Heroides were probably the
earliest of his works, itis quite possible that Propertius may have
been acquainted with them when he wrote this poem.
