PROPERTJUS,111. 5, 25-47. 287

and here shall thy proud waves be stayed; and Psalm 104.9
Thou last set a bound that they may not pass over, that they turn
'cot again to cover the earth. .

exeat, with an accusative, as in Ov. Met. 10. 52 domc Avernas
Exierit valles.

88. eat, of the progress of the year; just as in 3. 1. 8, of the
march os his verse.

89. sint tura deum, either ‘whether the gods dispense justice,'
or rather ‘have jurisdiction, hold sway.’ See above ou 3. 4. 4.

41. Alcmaeon slew his mother Eriphyle by his father Amphi-
araus’ injunctions: he went mad and was haunted by the Furias.
Phineus, the blind soothsayer, was punished for satage cruelty to his
sons3 whenever food was plaoed before him, it was carried off or
fouled by the Harpies.

Le. whether the tales about Ixion, Sisyphus, Tantalus, are
44. pauca, to be taken as the predicate, ‘ are all too few.’ Prof.
Palmer would now read pressa for pauca. He thinks pauca arose

had begun to write pressa, and compares Ov. Met. 1. 458 tot iugera
ventre prementem.

45. An nota fabula, ‘or naught but tales and fancies.‘ See

closing days, of lise?

111. 7· ’ ’

Α YOUNG friend of the poet, called Paetus, had been drowned in
the course of a voyage to Egypt, whither he was bound ou some
trading venture. Assumiug therefore that lust for gold was the cause
of his frieud’s end, Propertius describes with much pathos the circum-
stances of his death, and moralises upon the avarice of man and the
rash daring which it inspires. It is one of the most beautiful of his
pieces, full of an exquisite tender pathos, and showing a high
imaginative capacity, such as is rarely to be found in ancient poetry,
sor feeling and interpreting the wilder moods of nature. This poem
would alone be enough to refute the common idea that Propertius
was a mere love poet, whose oue and only inspiratiou was found in
Cynthia. On the contrary, it raises the presumptiou that Cynthia
did as much to degrade or divert his muse as to create it, and fills
onef3with regret that he did not devote his genius to nobler themes.
