268 NOTES.

l'haeacian.' used as a synonym for ‘fat and comfortable,’ Hau
1. 13. 24, and asan adjective by Juv. 15, 2 3 Phaeaxpapulus.

mea, emphatic.

aequant, here intransitive, ‘rises to the level oi,' ‘isequl
to.‘ The proper meaning is transitive, ‘to make equal‚' i. e. ‘to mir
one thing equal to another.' In Virg. Geo. 1. 113

Cum primum sulcos aequant sata,
the meaning is ambiguous: the word may either mean ‘maie ue
furrows equal,' i. e. to each other, by obliterating all signs oi the ridges
or else ‘rise to the level of, become equal to, the furrows?

12. For operosa antra see 3. 1. 5 and note. The water fortir
grotto was to come from the famous Aqua Marcia, the first oi m
great Roman aqueducts which was conducted for a considemblel
distance on arches. It was built by Q. Marcius Rex, Β. c. 145,b1ing·
ing its water from Sublaqueum (the modern Subzirco), a dianes
over sixty Roman miles. Of this distance more than seven milesius
above ground: aud the remains oi these arches, together with those
of the more magnificent Aqua Claudia (built by the emperor
Claudius), form to this day one os the most impressive features οἱὼς
Roman Campagna. Iu an archwayin the ancient walls, close totae

modern Porta S. Lorenzo‚ are still to be seen high in air the specus

or channels by which three of the principal sources of water-supply
reached the city, the Marcia, the Tepula, and the Julia. The lowest
of the three is the Marcia: and it bears the following inscription.
reeording its restoration by Vespasian: Imp Titus Caesar Diui I.
Vespasianus Α ug. Parit. Max. tribuniciae potest. IX Imp. XV Cas.
Cos. VII Desigu VIII rivum aquae Marciae vetustate dilapsum
refecit et aquam quac iu usu esse desierat reduxit. Propertius again
speaks of this aqueduct 3. 22. 24
Aeternum Marcius humor aptis.

The distribution of the water through the city was effeeted by leadeu
pipes (see Hor. Ep. 1. 10. 20): and Propertius in the present passage
refers to the possibility of ‘ laying on' the Marcian water by such a
pipe to an artifieial Muses’ grotta But though the Romans used
pipes to distribute vvater downwards from the higher points οἱ the
aqueducts, it is clear that they did not know that water would rise to
its own level if confined: otherwise they would not have built miles
upon miles of archways to bring their water across the low ground oi
the Campagna. The Auia Itbvus travelled over fourteen mileses
arches, some os them 109 feet in heightl

13. cara. Lachmann quite unnecessarily adopts the variam
graia.
