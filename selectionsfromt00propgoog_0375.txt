308 aaran.

e. g. stringere ferrum, usually wrongly translated ‘to draw.' Strict
gladio is ‘sword in hand.’ How it came to signify ‘just to toucl
and no more' is not clear: perhaps from the idea of pressing o:
touching without penetrating. Thus Virg. Aen. 5. 163

Litus ama, et laeuas stringat sine palmula cautes;
and in Ov. Am. 3. a. 12, of chariots just grazing the meta,

Nune stringam metas interiore rota.

ab, not exactly redundant: it states the causation in a more
emphatic way, or denotes the effect as immediate. Excidetab
aava, 3. a. 25, quoted by Palmer, is different; putris ab aesta, 4.
3. 39, is ‘in consequence of the heat' It is hard however to give
ab any special meaning in a. 27. 11

Solus aurens novit quando periturus, et a qua*
Morte.

25. In allusion, apparently, to the great dykes attributed 1⁰
Semiramis by Herod. 1. 184, by which he says the Euphrates, which
formerly inundated the whole plain, was kept within its banis.
Duxit is here used for the making of a new charmel, and so ‘leading
off ’ or ‘diverting’ the waters: cp. aquaeductus. Propertius' idffl
seems to be that she introduced the water into the city.

26. surgere. Propertius evidently makes a confusion between
the taking of Bactra, which Semiramis accomplished, and the founding
of her capital. Baetra, the capital of Bactriana, was known to the
Romans as forming the most distant part of the Parthian emplfess
hence they use the name vaguely as synonymous with the extreme
nass. so Hor. oa. 3. 29. 28, virg. ceo. 2138, Aen. aeas. nal
three passages the city Bactra is used instead of Bactriana, ΕΠ·
dently in ignorance. To a Roman mind the Euphrates would ⁸²
once suggest the Parthians. There is thus no need to change tif·
gere, with Burmann and Lachmann, into subdere.

27. Rapere in ius is a common expression: in oriminewffl
mean therefore ‘in advancing my impeachment.'

nam, as frequently, gives the reason not for a statement madh
but the reason why the writer makes (or, as here, omits to male)l
statement. ‘I pass on from Semiramis-for what need to instance
heroes and gods when we have the example of Jupiter himself l‘
and tell of our latest and greatest scandal.' See Hertzberg's refer·
ences, especially Stat. Silv. 2. 1. 210

abeunt noctesque diesque
Astraque, nec solidis prodest sua ruachina terris ,·
Nam papulas, mortale genus, plebisque caducae
Quis fleat interitus?
