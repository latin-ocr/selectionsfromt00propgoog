PROPERTIUS, 1. 8., 16-21. 191

Ι· ao the andin utere, and then back to the 3rd in accipiat, this reading
,ς is the best yet proposed. '
¹ praevecta, used oi riding or gliding past, aa in Tac. Anu. a. 6
’ς of the Rhone, servat nomen qua Germaniam praevehitvr. H. A.
ι.. J. Muuro (Journal oi Philia. p. 49), besides objecting to the asyn-
Ῐ- deton os the MS. reading, and to the omission oste l. 20, holds
’Ξ that it is impossible to use the past part. praevecta iu the sense
of the present part, showing that Lachmann’s instances olpraeter-
ί vehar are all iu the present tense, and comparing Livy’s praetervehens
. equo with Cicero’s use of praetervecta in the pass. (pro Cael.51). He
. therefore repeats the conj. Ut te praevectam felice Ceraunia reme,
pointing out that felice occurs in Cicero, and infelice in Catullus.
But praevecta, as practically equivalent to a pres. part, may be
illustrated by provectas 1. 143 and is we read utere, tbe objectiou
to praevecta is practically removed. The rowing would not be
pronounced felix until the dangers were passed.
⁴ cornuta, referring to the precipitous cliff and acute promon-
tory called Acroceraunia, which forms the terminatiou of the
Ceraunian Mountains. This promontory was just to the north of
Oricum (or Oricos), and was the main terror os the passage from
, Italy to Greece. Bold indeed must have been the man, says Hor.
od. 1. 3. 19, who first dared to face the sea:

Qui vidit mare turgidum et
Insames scapulas Acroceraunia.

, . 20. ortena or Oricum, a town ou the confines os Illyria aud
Epirus, at which passengers bound for Rome would wait for favour·
able weather. Thus Asteria’s lover Gyges is detained at Oricum,¹

Hor. Od. 3. 7. 5
Ille Notis ‘actus ad Oricum

Post insana Caprae sidera.
Oricum aud Dyrrhachium (further north on the same coast) were
the Calais and Boulogne‚ as Brundusium was the Dover or
Folkestone, of the Roman world.

21. ¹lton ullae aean. The torcb was so esseutial a part of
the marriage processioa, as it was also of the funeral procession‚
that the word taeda by itsell may stand ior either ceremouy. Thus
in Prop. 4. 11. 46 the shade of Cornelia describes her whole wedded
life by the words .

Viximus insignes inter utramque facem,

Et sace pro thalami sax mihi martis erit.
