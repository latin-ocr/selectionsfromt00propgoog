11. 6.

THE poet Aemilius Maoer had gone forth to the wars3 taking
contage from his example, and distracted by the cruelties and caprice
of his beloved Nemesis, Tibullus determines to buckle on his armour
and to cure himself of his love by absence. But alas! the very

thought of leaving Nemesis behind unmans him; once more he turns .

1. Bauer. We have to distingmshbeween two contempora
neous poets of the same name.

(1 ) 1Aemilius Macer of Verona, who according to the Eusebian
chronicle died in Asia B.c. 16. He was apparently a friend of
Virgil, for Serv. ap. E. 5 says that by Mopsus intelligitur Aemilius
Macer Veronensis poeta, amicus Vergili. He wrote a poem on
birds, snakes, and plants, as appears from Ov. Trist. 4. 10. 43

Saepe suos volucres legit milii grandior aevo
Quaeque necet serpens, quae iuuet herba, Macer.
Manilius alludes to this poem Astr. a. 43 in similar terms. Quin· ·
tilian contrasts him with Lucretius, whom he terms difficilis, while
Macer is humilis, both being elegantes in sna materia.

(a) The Macer addressed by Ovid in Am. a. 18 and in E. Ρ.
2. ιο. 13, and therefore alive in iac. 12. Ovid speaks of him as au
old companion, and thus describes his poetry:

Tu canis aelerm quidquid restabat Homero,
Ne careant namma T roica bello manu.
In E. P. 4 16. 6 he calls him Iliacus Macer, which implies that
there were two of the name, and that one of them was known as a
compilet of Homeric poems. See Wemsdorff on the Homeristae
Latini in his Poetae Latini Minores.
quio flet Amori. ‘What will become of Lovel’ Fiet in this
sense is construeted both with (a) the dative, and (b) the ablativo:
the former being the dative of the thing or person affected, ‘what
will happen to;’ the latter being the ablative of theinstrument,
‘what will be done by or with? Thus for (a) see Liv. 45. 39 Quid
deinde tam opimae praedae, tan operientae victoriae spoliis fiet? So
Ov. A. Α. 1. 5 36; for (b) Cic. Epp. Att.6. 1 Quid illo fiet quem
reliquero? quid meantem si non tom cito decedo?
3. vaga, ‘unstable,’ ‘uncertain’ So Tib. a. 3. 39
Praeda vago iussit geminare pericula ponto.
