’ Percussis can only refer to striking the cheeks, perscissis to
tearing them in grief ε neither is appropriate as applied to the
shades of themselves. Exesis, the conjecture oi Heinsius, makes
the best sense, bnt involves a great change in the tert.

40. occupat, ‘comes npon him,' ‘ overtakes him: with the im·
plication ‘before he is aware oi it.'

42. Cp. Hor. Epod. r. 42.

46. maturos, to be taken closely with duxit.

48. testa paterna. ‘The amphora stored up, or laid in, by
his father? Cp. Ov. A. A. a. 695

Qui properant, ruva musta bibant ; milri fundat auitum

Consulibus priscis condita testa runem. ’
The amphora was the earthenware vessel in which wine was kept
stored up sor use, aiter all the processes of making had been gone
through. Though holding over five and a half quarts, it was thus
the counterpart of the modern bottle; it was long in shape, had two
handles at the neck, and ended in a point at the bottom which
was stuck into the ground, whilst the head leant against the wall,
or against other amphorae. Great numbers of amphorae bave been
found in this position, just as they were leit by their owners.

50. eiius (from sino) properly means ‘a lying,’ ‘a situation ι’
it is hence used of every kind of filth, such as dust, rust, monld,
weeds, etc, which gather upon things which are lest untonched.
Thus Prop. 4 5. 72
iurnuudo pallida mitra situ.

51. Ξ luco. Another touch to describe the happy times oi
peace. The father with his wife and family have been to a festival
in some sacred grove close by: so Hor. Od 1. 4 11 of spring,

Nunc et iu umbrosis Fauno decet rbrnrolare lucis ; ¹
and Virg. Aen. 11. 739

Hic amor, hoc studium ; duur sacra secundus haruspex

Nuntiet, ac lucos uocet hostia pruguis iu altos.

From such a feast it would appear that the father might be
expected to come home in the same condition as too many a modern
farmer from sair or market: so Hor. A. P. ²²3

Illecebris erat et grata ruuz'tate morandus
Spectator, furutusque sacris et petris et exlex ;

and Tib. a. 1. ²9

nou festa luce madere
Est rubor, errantes et reale serre pedes.

ipse. Only the father got drnnk. Some editors suppose ipse
to mean ‘with his own hands’ as having no slave. But iihewere
