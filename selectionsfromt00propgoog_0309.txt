242 NOTES.

μὴ πτερύγων τρομέοι τις ἔτήλυσιν· ἐξότε γάρ μοι
λάξ ἐπιβὰς στέρνοις πικρὸν ἔπηξε πόδα,

ἀστεμφής, aalma ἐνέξεται, οὐδὲ arrian,

llere Love tramples on the lover’s breast, and, having lost his dna
cannot tly away.

16. See note on l. 6. ·

17. sisois medullis. Love has dmined him of his lits
blood, either by the wounds of his arrows, or actually hydrinkiu
it. Thus Theocr. Id. 2. 55 represents Love as fastening like sled
on to the lover's flesh and drinking his blood dry.

18. ‘Carry thy darts elsewhither.’

19. veneno, a new metaphor: but perhaps the idea maybetld,

20. tenuis umbra msa, probably in allusion to the pedi

it in the MSS, which Lachmann and other editors believe, withotss
sufficient reason, to have formed a separate poem, Those lines
repeat the oft-told, well-worn theme that love for Cynthia istie
inspirer of the poet's muse; and though lighter in tone than the
succecding verses, which deal with the poet's death und funeral, de
contrast is scarcely stronger than is to be found in other
His love for Cynthia is the one portal through which Propertius
approaches every subject; and we have seen elsewhere (espee'nlly
2. 1. 71-78) in how morbid (or shall we say puerilell a fashionle
