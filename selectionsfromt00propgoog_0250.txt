TIBULLUS,111.‘3.,33-5.,1-18. 183 ’

ς general, like the word ‘Spaz 'v ‘greatest amongst hot springs, on iccount
of its holy waters.’ But no proos of such a use has been adduced, to
; say nothing os the intolerable ambiguity which itwonld introduce
- here. Others wrest maxima into the sense os maier, meaning ‘su-
- perior? Thisisno less inadmissible. It has been noted that autem
is not elsewhere used by Tibullus. The words nraximus and proxi·
mus are not unsrequently interchanged in MSS.
4. aa remittit. ‘unbends from,' ‘is released,’ i. e. from the cold
of winter. Ov. Fast4„ 126

Vere nitent terrae, vere remissus ager.

The winter is regarded as presenting an interruption to the normal
state os the earth.

purpureo vere, ‘under the influenee of spring!

ὅ. uictam contrasted, as D. points out, with purpureo l. 4. For
nigra lora cp. niger dies Prop. 2. 24. 34. ,

denuntiat. This verb is often used in the sense of threatening:
inimicitias, eaedem, vim denuntiare, etc. occur iu Cicero.

8: laudandae deae. The Bona Dea, to whose rites no male
might be admitted. Tib. 1. 6. aa

Sacra boam nearilus non admeuia Deae.

It is well known what serious consequences, political and personal,
were entailed by the violation of these rites by Clodius in Caesar's
house uc 62.

9. infecit pocula, ‘drugged a bowl' W. R.

10. enea, ‘ponnded’ A. has certa. Trita venena occurs also
Prop.2.17.14. ⁷⁹3 ppympffl, ⁰⁷4 (dhrlr rorpryuyce'vay mm'li‘lc

ll. sacrilegos is not quite so well supported as sacrilegi, but it
gives a better sense. And if sacrilegi would readily be changed to
sacrilegos to agree with igms (Pinder), sacrilegos might still more
readily be changed to sacrilegi to agree with nos.

13. iurgia mentia. Lachmann illustrates by this phrase the
iurgia saevitiae ol Prop. 1. 3. 18. ‘Brooding over the resentments ’
os a irenzied mind’ Pinder.

18. This line occurs in Ovid's autobiography, Trist. 410. 6,
and it is extremely unlikely that Tibullus would have horrowed so
marked a line literally‚ aud without acknowledgment. Further, it is
certain that he was born at least eleven years, probably sixteen years,
before the event indicated, which took place Β, c. 43. See Intro-
duction. Either, therefore, these lines are interpolated, or else the
author was not the poet Tibullus. As a matter of fact, the lines are
quite out of place where they stand.
