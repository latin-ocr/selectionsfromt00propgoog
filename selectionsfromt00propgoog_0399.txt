Pliny and Mela had vagae ideas oi an cous oceanus or eoum moa, “
which they held to bound India on the Euat, and proposes ane ³
aquae, translating ‘ And the Indian ol the Eustern wave burnt toadis
coloured hue? But if the Indian could be described as ⁸ ot' the Fast- '⁴
ern wavess he might equally well be said to live orbe ‘ on the Eadem f]
wuve,’ and to most persons the latter will seem the more namral ex· ⁴
pression. Indus is no doubt,asthe whole passage showS,‘the Indian'
not ‘the river Indtrs.’ As applied to the river Indus, discolor would
give a good sense, as it is a fact that the colour of its waters presente
a strong contrast to that oi the blue sea at its mouth. It' decoorte
applied to the Indian, it can only mean ‘of a colour different hom
us‚‘ or ⁴ from the rest of mankind? Cp. Virg. Aen. 6. 204

Discolor urrde auri per ramos auro refulsit,
where discolor means ‘of a colour different from that ot' the objects
around it!

zoa . . . aqua, on the above view must be an ablative ospitat,

‘on the shores ol the Eastern waters.‘ Cp. 1.14. 1

Tu licet abiectus Tiberina molliter unda ;
and 2. 13. 55 (if we follow the MSS.)

Illic formosum tacuisse paludibus.

A simpler interpretation, however, ol this passage may be suggested.
Every one knows the effect of a‘strong sun reflected from the seuin
sun-burning the skin: why should not Propertius mean quite naturally
‘The Indian bumt to a discoloured hue hythe Eastern wavel'
The Romans ,only knew of the Indian coast; they knew ol the sea
that washed it as being ever under a broiling tropical sun, and may
well have attributed to this cause, at least in part, the swarthy com·
plexion oi the indiuns. Cp. especially 3. 13. 15, 16.

11. marita, here used as a participle=‘thy wedded troth,’as

et pactae. Paley much improves the point ol this line by
reading et sic pactae milri noctes, etc. ‘Was it on these terms that
