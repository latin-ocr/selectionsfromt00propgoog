· young wife to her absent husband; in another the
victory of Actium is celebrated, and the book closes
with the magnificent Elegy on the noble matron Cor·
nelia. Two of the poems of this book, and two only,
can be dated. These are the sixth and eleventh‚ both of
which must be referred to the year Β. α 16. The former
was written to commemorate the celebration of the

ludi quinquennalem the latter, l. 66, alludes tothe con· .

sulship of P. Cornelius Scipio, both of which events took
place in that year. Most editors are agreed in holding
that the whole book was published posthumously. Be-

they seem a very fulfilment of the poet’s own promise
in 3. 5. 19 sqq, that while devoted to Love and Bacchus
in his hot youth, he will turn, with advancing age, to graver
themes. Now had Propertius turned to antiquarian sub-
jects in his youth, we may be certain that he would have
gone to the mythology of Greece for his subject. When he
began to write, he was saturated with the forms and the
spirit of Greek mythology; he had carried an imagination
and an enthusiasm into the study which burst through
all the artificia] wrappings in which his Alexandrino
masters had embedded it; but there is nothing in his
earlier poems to show that he had expended any interest Ι
