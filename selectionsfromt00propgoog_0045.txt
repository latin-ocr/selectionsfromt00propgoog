xxxviii [ΝΤ RODUCT ION

‘Faithful thou wert, ah me t> though not sprung from
noble ancestors, nor over rich withal.’

So again, 2. 34. 55

Aspice me, cui parva domi fortuna relicta est,
Nullus et antiquo Marte triumphus aui.

‘See me, to whom but modest home and fortune have
been left, and who have no ancestors that gained triumphs
in ancient war!

At an early age he lost his father, 4. 1. 127-130

Ossaque legisti non illa aetate legenda
Patris, et in tenues cogeris ipse Lares:
Nam tua cum multi versarent rura iuvenci,

Abstulit excultas pertica trz'stz's opes.

‘ Thou didst gather thy fathers bones at an age that was
no't meet, and wast th'yself reduced to a slender horne:
full many a steer was wont to plough thy lands, but the
accursed measuring-rod (i. e. of confiscation) took that
well-tilled wealth away.’ Ι

The latter lines inform us that soon after his father’s
death his property was included, either in whole or in
part-as the words cui parva domi fortuna relicta est
seem to imply—arnong those confiscated hythe triumvirs
in Β. α 41. Mr. Postgate has pointed out that the horror
with which the poet speaks of the siege of Perusia in lac. 41
-in the course of which he lost one of his relatives-is
to be explained by the fact that that event was associated
with the lowest period of the family fortunes, and that
Propertius himself, as a timid sensitive boy, may have
witnessed some of the terrible scenes that attended it.
His father dead, his property confiscated, he was brought
up under the supervision of his mother, who in all proba·
bility took him to Rome for his education, and expended
upon him the same loving care that Horace informs us
he experienced at the hands of his father. He received,
at any rate, the best education which Rome could afford,
and in due tirne, his mother being still alive, he assumed
the toga virilis.
