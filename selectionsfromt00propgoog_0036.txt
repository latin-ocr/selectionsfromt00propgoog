the fourteenth century. lt has been corrected by various
hands, but these corrections are all of little orno value.

These two MSS. resemble each other so closely, that
it is evident they are derived from a common archetype.
To this same family belong the various MSS. of the
fifteenth century-including those relied upon by Lach-
mann—which departed more and more widely from the
original, and suffered much from interpolations by Joannes
Aurispa, Thomas Seneca, Jovianus Fontanus, and other
scholars of that century. .

But Baehrens believes that he has lighted upon a MS.
which belongs to a different and older family than AV.
Lachmann set great store by certain readings noted in
1501 by F ranciscus Puccius, who professed to have de·
rived them from an old MS. This MS. Baehrens believes
he has found in

G or Codex Guelferbytanus, a folio MS. now at
Wolfenbiittel, on parchment, which contains the works of
Tibullus on thirty-eight leaves, along with other matter.
The writing is an imitation of the Langobardic character
of the tenth or eleventh century, but Baehrens holds that it ¹

later hand, not only on the margin, but between the lines,
and even in the text itself. These corrections are some-
times taken from a MS. of the A V family, but are for the
most part worthless. The text itself, from its similarity to
the readings of Puccius‚ Baehrens holds to be the very .
MS. used by him : it seems to be derived from a different
original from A V, but to belong to the same family as the

Excerpta Parisina, a book of extracts from various
ancient authors, compiled by some learned F renchman
between 1ooo and 1100 A. D. This collection contained
passages from Tibullus l and ΙΙ : these were seen byVin-
centius BellovacensiS, a writer of the thirteenth century,
and other writers of that time: a copy carne into the
hands of Scaliger, and Meyncke has collected the pas-
