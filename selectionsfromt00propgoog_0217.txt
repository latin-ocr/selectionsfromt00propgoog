their engineering works are more impreseive or dunble llun Μ
great military roads. So solidly were they built that the plu!
used for making a road is munire viam: and the archites liin·
rius, who lived under Caesar and Augustus, has left n erro
account of the mode os their construction. First the arth nt
levelled and rammed down till itwus solid3 then carne a layud
rough stones lor a foundation, with or without cement; aborelhlra
second layer of rubble, mixed with lime, and rummed down tos
thickness osnine inches On the top of all was a layer ol hard pern
ment stones, generally irregular in shupe, laid carelnlly in ι boiol

Tuis piece is probably the earliest of Tibullus’ poema, and rt·

on thc occasion os his being called out as ayouugster to servehh

from the peacelul pursuits and secure joy of his ancestral acres; but
in what cause, or in what quarter, he was to serre, we have no hin
to tcll. Il he were born, as supposed, in the year Μ. 59, hir
obligation to military service would naturally have commennediu

been called upon to form part ol the forces that were being raised iu
that year in preparation sor thc campaign os Philippi. It ia interesting
to think that Tibullus may have formed part ol the pursuinghon
