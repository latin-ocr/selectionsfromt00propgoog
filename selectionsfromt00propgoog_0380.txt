classes. Referring, apparently, to the incredible exertions by
which Scipio had a fleel of sixty vessels built and equipped in
forty-five days from the time of the felling of the timber.

60. Pompeia, used asan adjective for Pompeiana.

Bosporo, i. e. the country adjoining the Cimmerian Bosporus
(straits of Kertsch) which Pompey assigned to Pharnaces after the
conquest of Mithridates.

61. monimenta, in allusion to the spot called Lacus Curtius
in the forum, which marked the heroic sacrifice of M. Curtius, Liv.

svam. A Numidian prince, taken by Masinissa in B. c. 203,
and conveyed by Laelius to Rome to adorn Scipio's triumph.

62. An expressive line. Pyrrhus came over to Italy in the
height of his reputation‚ being estecmed the greatest warrior of his
tinie3 iu spite os his brilliant successes at Heraclea (ue. 280), at
Asculum (279), and in Sicily (278-276), he was utterly defeated, and
his fortunes shipwrecked, at Beneventum (275).

64. Palmer unnecessarily adopts Scaliger's conjecture Decius
admisse for the MS. reading At Decius misso. Mittere is frequently
used where speed and strength are implied: cp. mittere vocem, cur-
rum, hastarufulmiua, se ab saxo, etc. The allusion of course is to
the sels-devotion of P. Decius Mus in the great battle against the

running up from the bridge which he ‘kept so well’

68. The mingled flattery and blasphemy of this line could
scarce be matched.

69. At the southern extremity of the island of Leucasx was a
famous precipitous promontory called Leucas, Leucates, or Leucate.
On the summit of the cliff stood the temple of the Leucadian Apollo.
Tberc was also a temple of Apelle Actz'ceus or Actius at Actium,
in Acarnania, at the southern entrance of the Ambracian guls. Au-
gustus beautified this temple, and instituted games here, in honour
of his victory. Propertius apparently consounds the two places:
fdr the Apollo at the southern end of Leucadia could not have been
a witness of a battle fought some miles to the north of the northern
extremity of the island. ·

70. Lit. ‘so much of the work of war has one day made away
with! The idea seems to be that all previous exploits of war are
destroyed, blotted out, because they will not be deemed worthy of
being remembered in comparison with Caesar's great victory. Pinder
supposes epem's belli to refer only to the war against Antony: ‘so
much has the day of Actium done for deciding the whole wari usu
