‘Elysiuna again, is a happy plain on the western confines of tlt
earth, cooled by Ocean breezes, where certain favoured men lim
life os bliss. The description in Homer Od. 4. 562 forms pul
of the prophecy delivered by Proteus to Menelaus, and is well hon
on account of its exquisite beauty.

‘Let us now briefly compare these statements wlth the picra
drawn by Virgil, who, although following in the steps of the μ
master, has embellished his descriptione with many particula fe
rived, in part, perhaps, from his own imagination, but chieflytn
the later Greek poets and philosophers.

1. ‘The rivers Acheron, styx, Cocytus, Phlegethon, mellaris
nether world. It is not easy to seize the conception formed sywal
os their position and connection, but it is clear that they fomlt
boundary, and that it is necessary that one of them should beuod
by the spirits os the dead before they can gain necess to Μ
destined abode.

a. ‘They are transported across by the grim ferryman chum
personage unknown to Homer, and those only are allowed to μΙ
who have received the rites os sepulture. Those whose bodies re
main unburied are compelled to wander ¹disconsolate for the terud
ahundred years, a condition unknown to Homer. On the finio
side of the stream is the cave of Cerberus (Homer speaks of the dl!
of Hades, and he is named by Hesiod), and beyond is a regin
tenanted by those who have died a violent death before the lou
appointed by fate.

3. ‘ Tartarus, at the entrance of which sits the fnry Tisthonal·
a deep gulph which opens out of the realms of Pluto, and arte
general place of punishment for the Titane, ὼε Hundred-mndel.
Tantalus, Sisyphus, the Danaids, and all impious men.

4. ‘Elysium is in the lower world, and is the blissfnl abodetf
all me virtuous.
