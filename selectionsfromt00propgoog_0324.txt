PROPERTIUS, 11. 31, 7-16; 111.,1. 257

III. 1.

his Elegy Propertius asserts his claims as a poet, acknow-
his masters and his models, proclaims his originality, and
s that aster death his fame will rise triumphant out os all
acks of his detractors. It is interesting to compare it with
td, 4. 3, which is one of Horace’s most artistic Odes, and is
l to the same subject. Many oi the same ideas run through
ieoes, though the manner of working them in, and the
d temper of the two poems, are very different. There is in
>ratian poem a sense of power, a calm dignity and seli-
tt, a simplicity and faithfulness to fact, an absence of seli even
peaking of self, a true conception of what makes ὼε poet
rat the poet is, lastly a tendet music running through the
piece, which stamp it as the work of true poetic genius.
ve in the Horatian Ode, as in the Propertian, the idea of the
1 of the chariot-race, os the influences which mould the
faculty, of the detracting work oi envy, oi the certainty oi
approving verdict; but Horace has the consummate art to
sry idea in its right place, and give it its importauce with
:e to the whole; he speaks with ffie simplicity and modesty
greatness, aud proves his right to fame by the very manner
renounciug it. Propertius is somewhat fussy in his seli-
n; he pushes his rivals rudely by; he does not observe a
,er in his ideas, but proclairris his triumph first, records ffle
sior it afterwards, and acknowledges lastly that, aster all, it
been yet awarded to him: he acquaints us with the source
inspiratiou before he has made us feel that he is inspired,
t Horace first makes us scel that he is a poet, and not till
es he tell us that all his merit is the Muse's gift. Lastly, while
ius has to glorify his models if he would exalt the copyist,
»ks to such frigid sources os inspiration as Muses' grottoes
‘ses’ inspiring founts, Horace appeals to Nature as the true
er of poets in those noble and tuneful words which Words-
night sain have written: ’ ,
Sed quae Tibur aquae fertile praefluunt,
Et spissae nemorum comae,
Fingens Aeolio carmine nabilem.

4. Addressing the shades of Callimachus and Philetas, the
ays for admission to their sacred grove: then assuming that
yer is granted, he claims to be the first inspired hard who

lded the rites os Italy to the song oi Greece. emmaum
