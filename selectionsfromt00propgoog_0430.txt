propatruus, iv. 11, mu· 363

Achilli is as good a form as Achillis, and is best supported here
by the MSS.

40. proavo , . . Achille. The tannting repetition of these
words is similar to Horace's libertino patre natum Sat. 1. 6. 6,
etc„ a taunt against himself which he repeats several times, half in
pride, half in irritation.

The late Mr. Munro’s great reputation makes it worth while to
state shortly his view of this whole passage. Rejecting the MS
reading of l. 40 on every ground of grammar, sense, and metre, he
believes that awhole distich has fallen out, l. 38 beginning with Et or
Et qui, and that for Achille, 1. 40, we are to look sor some other pro-
auus of Perses, to enhance still more the glory of his conqueror
Aemilius Paulus. Suggesting first that this proauus may be Alex-
ander, he proposes either Atossa or Amastri, two famous Persian
queens, who would stand for the royal house of Persia: but finally he
believes Alexander’s paterna] descent from Hercules to be alluded to,

“ and Hercules himself to be described by reference to his last and
greatest achievement, his breaking into Hades, dragging away Cer-
berus, and restoring Theseus to the light. Thus by a process of reason· ‘lq
ing truly marvellous‚ and by a display-of wholly irrelevant learning, ’
he has persuaded himself that Propertius wrote the passage thus:

Testor maiorum cineres tibi Roma verendos,
Sub quorum titulis, Africa, tonsa iaces,
Et qui contuderunt animos pugnacis Hiberi
Hannibalemque armis Antiochumque suis,
Et Persen proavi simulantem pectus Achilli,
Quique tuas proavus fregit, Avenae, doulos
Me neque censurae legem mollisse, etc.

This is indeed rescribere, non emendare, Propertium with a ven
geance. Plessis reads feras for tuas.

41. Referring to her husband's censorship. He had no need, on
her account, to relax the severity of his office.

42. mea emphatic; ‘by no stain of mine?

43. munna, for the more usual damno. See note on a. 10. 6
aredaeia certe Laus erit.

45. aetas, well explained by Postgate, ‘ Ι throughout my lise!
So 1. 6. 21

Nam tua uon aetas umquem cessauit autori,
i. e. ‘ lfou have never yet, iu all your life, been in love.' Cp. e. 5. 27.

46. Cp. Ov. Her. 21. 172

Et jace praenotant fax milri mortis erit.
47. An amplification of the proverb Noblcssa obliga. Qum-
