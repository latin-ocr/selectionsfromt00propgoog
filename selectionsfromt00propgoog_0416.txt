burial: and like compono, in the same sense, conveys the idea ol

18. Lit. ‘a passage presenting no difficulties to the wows ol
sailors,’ ‘n e. ‘into which (harbour) there is a saie and easy chan-
nel.' The promontory ol Actium (Ἄκτιον, from ἀκτή, ‘a shore ') was
a long sharp point projecting from the south or Acamanian shore ;
between this point and the promontory which comesto meet it
from the shore of Epirus on the north, the channel at one point is '
no more than 700 yards in width. Ou a height close to the pro·
montory of Actium stood an ancient temple of Apollo -Actr'us or
Actiacas. Near this spot was the camp of Antony; his fleet lay in
the spacious bay within (now the Bay ol Prevesa), and he was
strong enough to occupy the straight itself‚ on either side of which
he had thrown up redoubts. Augustus was encamped on the north
or Epirote shore, on the spot where he afterwards founded the town
os Nicopolis in honour of his victory: his fieetlay at Comarus, a
point of the coast ot’ Epirus ontside the channel. He was unable to
force the entrance: and the great battle was brought on ontside the
straight, when Antony, dispirited by iailures and desertions, had
made up his mind to escape with his fleet to the East.
