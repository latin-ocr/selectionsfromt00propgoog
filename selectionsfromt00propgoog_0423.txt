This Lepidus was consul suffictus rac, 34, and censor in 13. e. aab
which capacity he completed the famous Basilica Aemilia, of which
a portion, built of brick, still survives as the front wall of the
Church of S. Adriano in the Forum. Cornelia left two sons anda
daughter. The elder son, Lucius, married his first cousin Julir,
grand-daughter of Augustus, and was consul in ΑΛ). 13 the younger,
Marcus, was consul in Α. 1). 6 with L. Arruntius, was employed h

ε important commands by Augustus, and was named by him, shortly

before his death, as one of the three possible aspirants to the empire:
M. Lepidum dixerat capacem sed aspernantem, Gallum Asinium
avidum et minorem, L. Arruntium nan indignum, et, sicaus
daretur, ausurum Tac Ann. 1. 13.

Of the daughter Lepida nothing certain is known. Cornelia ha·
self died in the year ean. 16, the year of her brother’s consulship, et
we learn from 1. 66. l* ⁹

The form of the poem is peculiar. Cornelia is supposed to utter
it after her death3 hence she ¹addresses alternately her husband as
to her past life, and the judges of the lower world as to her future.

Mr. Η. Α. J. Munro disputes the claim of this poem to be held nol
only the noblest elegy of Propertius, but ‘the queen of all elegies,’ as

, ’ it is held by some to be, and denies that it represents by any means

the poet's very highest inspiration. Ι should be inclined to differ from
him. There is a noble stateliness, an unconscious grandeur of self·
assertion, a true Roman strength in the way in which Cornelia
describes herself, her life, and her family, which enable us to form
a picture of the Roman matron such as can be gained from no othe
source—except perhaps by contemplatiug the statues of the Vati v: ι
—and which recall the words used by Aristotle of the μεγαλό
ψυχος, who ‘thinks himself worthy of great things, being worthy.
And the simple pathos and delicacy of the conclusion are unexcell·
in literature.

1. urgere, of any human emotion, implies force and insistance

. used similarly of the importuning of grief, Hor. Od. 2. 9. 9

T n semper urges flebilibus madir
Mysmn ademptum.

In urgere sepulcrum, as so often in ancient poetry (and especiall
throughout this poem), the simple physical idea is confused wi ι
and held to represent, the spiritual idea which it suggests.

2. ad, ‘in response to?

3. funera, the dead or the spirit of the dead. Funus is th
dead body in 1. 17. 8
