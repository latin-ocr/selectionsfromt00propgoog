ancient Egyptians: ‘The cause ol the yearly inundations ol the Nile
was au objectos much researeh even in ancient times. Herodotus

formed many conjectures respecting it, and decided lor the most

reasonable ot' them (Herod. 2. ao, etc). Agatharchides, however,
seems to have been the first to discover the truth (Agatharchid. ap.
Diodor. 1. p. 50). The coustant ruins, to which the districts of
Upper Ethiopia are subject during the wet season‚ from May to
September, swell all the rivers in those regions, the whole ol which
pour their floods into the Nile, which consequeutly becomes the re-
servoir ol this prodigious accumulation ol water. In the middle of
June, about the time oi the summer solstice, the Nile begins to rise
in Egypt. It continues to increase till the eud ol July, though still
coufined within its chaunel; but iu the first hall of August it over-
flows its banks, inundates the neighbouring territory ¹, and its waters
continue, without intermission, to extend themselves till September.
About this time, the torrents of rain in Ethiopia having ceased the

the territory of Egypt remains covered with its waters till the com·
mencement of October; and it is not till towards the end ol this
mouth that they completely return into their bed. The period of the
inundation, therefore, continues from the middle of August to the
end of October ; and during this time all the fertile valley of Egypt
