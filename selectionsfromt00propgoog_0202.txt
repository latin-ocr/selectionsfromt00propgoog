mannum, 1. 7.

Ι. 7.

Tn1s poem is a birthday panegyric in celebration oi the triumph
, of his patron Messalla, and os the various great services by which
that triumph was eamed. The triumph took place on the a4th 25* r
Sept B. c. 27, and it would seem that Messalla’s birtbday must
have fallen a lew days after that event, so that the poet rs able
dexterously to weave together the two causes ol congratulation. An
outline of Messalla's career has been given already in the note to ι.
,, 1. 53. The poet begins by celebrating his patron's victories in
Aquitania, aud enumerares the various tribes which he subdued.
He then passes outo describe his mission to the East, to which he
appears to have been appointed at the close oi lae. 30. During
the course os that year Augustus had received the submission of
Syria from Antonys legate Didius; the Antonian troops in Egypt
had surrendered, Antony and Cleopatra had⁸ committed suicide, and
from the 1st ol August Egypt had sorrnally been made' into a Roman
province Augustus prepared once more to winter at Samos rather
than return to Rome, not only because Sarnos was a central spot
from which he could keep an eye upon the course os affairs in the
East, but also because he wished to allow matters to ripen in the
“ City, and to make the need os his presence there the more keenlylelt.
With this view he had to keep his own hands free : so he summoned
over Messalla from Aquitania, and entrusted him apparently with a
general mission to make aprogress inthe East, to settle the
provinces, and to see that the dispositions made by himself
were carried into effect. Iu the course of this mission he passed
through Syria, Cilicia and Egypt. Augustus himself returned to
. Italy in lac, ³93 Messalla did not return to Rome till rac. 27
when he celebrated his triumph sor his Aquitanian successes
Tibullus accompanied Messalla upon this mission as far as Corcyra,
where he was taken ill, as we saw in Elegy 3, and was obliged to
stay behind.

It will be noted that Tibullus in this poem gives especial promi-
nence to Egypt, its gods and its fertility, and connects the acquisition ol
that country with the inauguration of a new era ol peace and plenty.
Egypt had by this time become the main granary ot' Rome ; its sale
keeping became a matter of special concern to the emperor; and its
inclusion within the strong grasp ol the Roman system was J'ustly
regarded as a pledge not less ol economic prosperity than os political
security.
