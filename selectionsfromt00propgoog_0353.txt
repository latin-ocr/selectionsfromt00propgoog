286 NOTES.

25. For the whole of the following passage cp. Virg. Gen. a.

26. hano manet domam, ‘this fabric oi the world) nm
means essentially a bullding, or structure of some kind. As pointed
out above on p. 210, studente are constantly led astray in translating
danius by the analogy oi our ‘home’ Cp. Virg. Aen. ιο. 1 dmm
Olympi, Geo. 1. 371

Eun'que Zephyrique domus,
and Prop. a. 16. 50

Fulminaque aetheria desiluisse domo.
So Shelley's blus dome osair.

27. sonore, as the contrast with exorz'ens seems to shov‚ol
the setting sun, not ol an eclipse. Gellius however has defio'entt '
luna oi the waning moon, as opposed to crescente; and thetmay
well be the meaning here. Lucan has comu coacto oi the full moon,
when the filling in of the orb makes the extremities oi the amomi
appear to meet, Phars. 1. 532.

Observe the indifferenoe with which Propertius uses the indies·
rive and subjunctive mood throughout this passage.

29. superant, in its literal meaning, ‘get up upon the Μ’
‘risa' So exactly Virg. Aen. 11. 5¹4

iugo superans adventat ad urbem,
‘mounting by the ridge thus reaches the city.’
31. ‘Whether a day is coming which,‘ etc. Lucretius affirms oi
the universe that
[hta dies dabit esitio, multosque per annos
Sustentata ruet moles et machina mundi.
Several editors read si forsit.

32. Pinder points out that the ancients believed that the rain·
bow sucked up water from the earth and gave it back in rain.

33. The Perrhaebi occupied t-he northern part of Thessaly.

34. ‘And the sun's orb mourned with his horses dsapodin
blank: a grandiloquent phrase sor an eclipse.

35. sarna versare, ‘slowin tuming.’

' Bootes, ‘the Ploughman‚’ called also Arcturus or Arctophylax,
‘the Beer—ward! The former name was applied to it because it
seems to represent the Ploughman orWaggoner who drives the whole
team round. Hence serus versare.

36. An admirable description of the Pleiades. The stara which

form the group (chorus) are so thickly set (spisso) that they appear
to run together (coit).

37. Cp. Job 38.11Hr'tlrerto sltolt thou conte, dut no further,
