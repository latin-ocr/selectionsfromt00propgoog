PROPERTJUS,111. 1.‚ 7-16. 261

'es him aloft; in 10 the car becomes a triumphal chariot‚ in which
ismuse, i. e. himself, is borne away, his Loves, like children, by his
ide (11), and a crowd of poets following at the wheels (12). In ¹. 3
e is in a chariot-race, on a course too narrow (14) ior his rivals to
ave any hope of passing him. ⁴ s
9. a me Rata, ‘sprung from myself,‘ ‘child of my brain‘ssiyou
Postgate), like the carmina nou prius audita of Hor. Od. 3. 1. 2. mma
10. coronatis, the horses of a triumphing general were
reached with garlands ; and
11. his young sons rode with him in the car: those who had
nained to manhood rode on horseback. Tacitus tells us that when
iermanicus triumphed he had five children in the car along with him.
12. The crowd of imitator poets follow after the car, as soldiers
let their general. secuta cannot exactly go with vectantur, as ⁴
iey were on foot. Either the general sense os ‘marching’ ‘ad-
mcing,’ is to be extracted from vectantur, or else secuta stands ior
uutafuerit or sit=sequatum
13. missis, ior the more usual immissis, of the reins shnken
sose upon the horses’ necks to urge them on. Thus immissis liabe- ·
s‘sVirg. Aen. 5. 662; immissis frenis id. 11. 889: the horses
semselves are immissi Cic. Fam. 10. 30. 3, etc.
111 me goes both with missis and certatis, of the goal or object
medat. Keats likensapoet toacharioteer in his‘Sleep and Poetryz'
For lo! I see afar
O'ersailing tlte bluc craggiucss, acar
And steeds with streamy manes-the charioteer
Looks out upon tlte uinis witi glorious faur:

T ie drivcr of those steeds' is forword berit. mihim*

14. currere lata, a rather harsh Greecism: ‘broad in the
nning.’ Cp. note on a. 13. 28. The peculinnty here1s that the noun
greeing with the adjective could not be (as usual) the subject of the
ub. It is the same kind of harshness to say via currit as pagina
tulit opus below, 1. 18. Currere might possibly also be taken as
relative of the whole sentence, instead of with latu only. There is
›broad-running road, no ‘royal road,' to the Muses. Pinder says
at two constructions are mixed up here, uon datur ad musas lata
'a‚ and nou datur currere lata via (ablative). What does this
ean? Is it not like sayiug that ‘ luta should be in the ablative. only
wouldn'tscani'

16. Here again we have the usual prophecy that Augustus will
<tend the Roman empire to the eastern confines ot Parthia. See
