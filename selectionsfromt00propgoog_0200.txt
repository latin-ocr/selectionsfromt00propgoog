, Epaphus, son ol Zeus and Io, became king ol Egypt, and wedded
Memphis, daughter os Nilus, by whom he had a daughter, Libya.
3 Libya bore to Poseidon twin sons, Agenor and Belus; Agenor
,- passed over to Phoenicia, where he reigned and became the patriarch
.- of a mighty tribe, while Belus remained in Egypt aud married
‚- Anchinoe, daughter os Nilus, who gave birth, to twin sons,
Aegyptus aud Danaus. Belus established Aegyptus in Arabia, and
Danaus in Libya3 the former, by many wives, was the father of
fisty sons, the latter of a like number ol daughters. Discord having
arisen between the brothers, Danaus, learing the sons of Aegyptus,
by the advice of Pallas, constructed a ship and fled to Argos,
where Gelanor, the reigning monarch, surrendered to him the sove-
reignty1. The sous of Aegyptus followed their uncle, entreated
“ him to lorego his anger, and to bestow on them his daughters in
marriage. Danaus distrusted their professions and still harboured
resentment, but consented to their proposal. On the day of the

his daughters he offered as priaes in a gymnastic contest, and awarded
g them to the victors. Apollodorus says nothing oi any punishment
' inflicted on the Danaids, but other writers leigned that they were
sentenced in the realms of Hades to draw water in a vessel full of
holes. Lucretius treats this as an allegory representing discontent‚
