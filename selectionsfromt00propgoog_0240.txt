are specified in the lines before us, in which Tibullus seeum to have
taken at random names commonly current, without investigating
very closely their origin or their relations to each other.

‘Amaltheo is in Varro¹ the Sibylla Cumana, who, he says, by
others is called Herophilo or Demophile. Again Herophilo, iu
Pausanias, is the Sibylla Erythraeo, but he quotes certain verses,
said to be composed by herself, in which she declares that she was a
native of Marpessus², a city of which, Pausanias adds, traces still
remained in his time upon Phrygian Ida. Α Marpessos, however, in
this situation is mentioned by no other ancient authority ³, while

’ Stephanus Byzantinus ⁴, Suidas and others place a Mermcsms on
this very spot. Hence Salmasius would change Μάρπησσος, in
Pausanias, into Μέρμησσος, and read Mormessio in Tibullus, instead of
Marpessia. But whether we adopt Marpessia orMermossio, it must be
taken asan epithet oi Herophile, and the punctuation oi Huschke,

Quidquid Amaltheo, quidquid Mormossio dixit,

Jrlerophilo Phoebo gratoque quod monuit,

by which Mermossia is made to indicate a personage distinct from
Herophile, cau scarcely be received. On the other hand, if we place
the comma after Herophile, as in our text, the words Phoebo
grataque quod monuit stand isolated without any noun to which
grato can be referred. Hence critics have supposed that Phoebo has
been substituted by some ignorant transcriber for the name os a
Sibyl, and Vossius would substitute Domo, who, according to Hy·
perochus, was the Cumano, while Lachmann conjectures Plauto
Graiaquc; Φύτω (Phyto Huschke), in Suidas, being the Samian
Sibyl.¹ Hiller reads: Phyto Graio quod admonuit. In Cat. 66. 58
the MSS. read Gratia, where Lachmann has restored Graio.

‘The next couplet, is we follow the best MSS, and read Albano
... Tiberis is absolutely unintelligible. The description, given by
Varro, oi the tenth Sibyl seems to afford the clue required to guide
us. Decimam Tiburtem, nomine Albuneam; quae Timeri colitur, ut
Dea, iuxta ripas amuis Anienis ; cuius ingurgito simulacrum aius

¹ Serv. Aen. 6. 72 says it is not clearly known which of the
Sibyls composed the Roman oracles, yet it is certain that they were -
brought to Tarquin by a woman named Amalthea. ¹

² Salmasius, however, has avery happy conjecture, according to
which ὼε Sibyl will declare that she herself was of Erythrae, and
tbi Hffissi’liaeirdlldioiiridtsaukifrildilsiiz reading is disputed.

⁴ Mepuyoods, πόλις Tpasur'y, ἀφ’ ἧς ἡ Ἐρυθραία Σίβυλλα. The MSS.
have also Μύρμισσος, and Suidas Μάρμισσος.
