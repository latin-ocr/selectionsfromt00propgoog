travellers to stop their chariots (2. 1. 75) or their horses to pnyt
tribute of respect to the dead—invocations often senselessly repatd
on modom tombstones. No man could approach the Etemnl cry
but through this City of the Dead: and it must have affordedt

‘having good hands,' commonly applied to a rider or driver who
knows how to handle a horse's mouth. Analogous is the phrase ‘ a ξ
good touch,' applied to manual performance on musical instruments¹
