complaint' Parallel to queri, ‘to utter complainingly,' is Virgil’s
me of rumpere with vocem. etc.¹ asin Aen. 11. 377
rumpitque hos imo pectore voces,
which means ‘To send sorth in a breaking or broken manner,' ‘To
. utter burstingly.‘ So Aen. 4. 553
Tantos illo suo rumpebat pectore questus.
For verba querar Postgate compares Ov. Met. 9. 304 verba queror,
md points out that Propertius frequently uses verbo where one
would expect the particular kind of words—whether of joy, sorrow,
or otherwise—to be indicated. Most editors have adopted Passerat's
conjecture uera which Palmer supports by 3. 6. 35
Quae tibi si veris ommis est questa puella.
But m that passage the whole point turns upon the truth of the
complaint made; here tbere' -1s no question oi true or salse, only ot'
his persistence in his love. Catull. 66. 18 also quoted' is quite
beside the mark. ‘I shall pour forth my woe in words upon thy
threshold’ is surely more foreible than ‘I shall utter well-founded

all a Roman lover’s woes and disappointments, and the recipient of
his most earnest protestations. In 1.16 awbole poem is devoted
to retailing the varied experiences of a limen, which betrays the
consessions of a rejected but still hopesul lover. Strange that the
one merit of such a confidant—that it could keep a secret—should
be so wantonly sacrificed. Cp. Catull. 67.

23. deficiet, used impersonally, or rather perhaps, bya carious
inversion, with the infinitive rogitare as a subject ‘The continual
questioning of sailors shall never fail me.’ An accusative of the person
after deficere is common, as Hor. Sat. 2. 1. 13 cupidum, pater
optino, vires Deficiunt.

citatos. He will send for, summon. all sailors who arrive in
port. to question them about Cynthia. The interpretation ‘moving
quickly' is very weak. As Paley points out, citare is a regular word
to use of summoning witnesses.

24. emuna, safe somewhere in harbour‚ as though she were
only detained by stress of weather from returning to him, like Gyges
in Hor. Od. 3. 7. 5-8, and were watching lor the first opportunity to
cross

Dicite.. ..eet The direct question indicates the urgency and
rapidity os his questions.
