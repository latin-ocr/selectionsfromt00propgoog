ΙΙΙ. 22.

ans poem may be read in conjunction with 1. 6. They are both
addressed to the poet's friend, Tullus, who, at the time oi the
marg oi that poem, was setting out for Asia in the suite of au
une, and had apparently asked Propertius to accompany him.
The poet declined the invitation, declaring that he had no taste for
var, and that he would rather stay at home to enjoy Cynthia’s love
thur see all the sights oi the East. The uncle is generally supposed
tohave been L. Volcatius Tullus, who was consul along with
Augustus in B. c. 33, and was son of the L. Volcatius Tullus, consul
Itc. 66, best known as furnishing a date to Horace's wine-jar, Od.

Consule Tullo.

Volcatius was settiug out for his provincial command in Asia when
1·6 was written, and the poet had the opportunity oi joining his
uite as Tibullus joined that oi Messala, and Catullus that of
Memmius. How much Propertius lost by the refusal may be
uasured by what we have gained from the charm and interest
thrown into the lives and writings of his fellow-poets by their travels
irthe East. In the 'present poem, Propertius complains that his
ttend has stayed away too long, and assures him that whatevermarvels
there may be in the East, there is, after all, no country like Italy,
which contains within herself all the charms and wonders of all
other countries. Closely parallel are Hor. od. 1. 7 and the well-
hrown praises oi Italy in Virg. Geo. a. 136-176. As to the date of
this poem, we find from 1.1 that Tullus has for many years (multos
arms) had Cyzicus as his headquarters. When did he go out?
Volcatius was consul in Β. c. 33, and, according to the rule estab-
lished by the Senate in Β. c. 52, no consul or praetor could enter
upon his provincial command until five years had elapsed from his
tenure of office in the city. If this rule was observed, we may
suppose that Volcatius did not go to Asia until rac. 27. That
would fix the date oi 1. 6: and this piece must have been written
some years (multos annos) afterwards.
