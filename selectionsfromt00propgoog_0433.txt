366 NOTES.

taken in a double, or even threefold, construction, as in Od. 3,

⁸⁰ ²⁰ rasus infestus aas luctuosis

Dissidet armis, ι

where the force of the line is intensified by the fact that sibi may be
taken, and is intended to be taken, with all the three words-in-
festus, luctuosis, Dissidet.

67. Appears to imply that her daughter was born in the year
of her father’s censorship. On what authority does Postgate take
specimen to be ‘a mirror i’ It rather meansa sample, by which a thing
may be seen or known: so Plaut. Most. 1. a. 51 of an illustration,

Tum specimen cernitur quo eveniat aedificatio.

69. sarie, i. e. by carrying on the line unbroken.'

maire. Each son was a‘prop’ to the house: see Postgate's
illustratione.

70. The MS. readings unctnsis or nupturis, and malis, are
clearly out of place: but 1 cannot see that Postgate's facta is an im·
provement. ..Mea fata is quite a Propertian expression, used widely
to denote her lot and position as a whole, including not only her
death (=me mortuam, Schultze), but her life, her family, and all
the circumstances of honour which she has just enumerated. ‘1 set
forth in Charon’s bark without regret, knowing that my own (ie.¹
children or family) will add yet more to my many titles to dis
linction' It is ,surelyinappropriate for a Roman matron to boast'
of her many deeds: but not of the many elements of honour with
which fate had surronnded her. For angere sacta in this sense
Postgate compares Tib. 1. 7. 55

quaefacta parentis Augeat:

but the facta, in that passage, are the exploits of a Messala.
Another interpretation, however, may be suggested. Tot may be
taken with nisis: she is addressing her children, and has just ex-
horted them to continue the race, Et serie filicitc genius. She may
well add, ‘I die willingly, leaving so many children behind me
who will add fresh lustre to my name and life.' Nor would it be
impossible for fata here to mean ‘death,’ as elsewhere ι ‘my children
will add fresh glory to my death,' i. e. ‘to me after Ι am dead and
gone,’ ‘to me even after death!

71. extrema, ‘the highest, crowning reward'

72. emeritum rogum, ‘the pyre of one who has served her (or
his) time.' Emeritnm does not of itself necessarily conveypraise: this
is done by laudat. The highest honour a woman can attain is that,
having lived her full time, she should receive praise at her death.
