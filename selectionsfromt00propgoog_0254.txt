tardis verginia, Abl. of Cause, ‘in consequence of the late
rising of the Vergiliae) The morning rising of the Vergiliae, or, to
nse their Greek name, the Pleiades, was held in a rough way to mark
the commencement of spring, and oi the sailing season. As to the
precise date indicated, there is great confusion in the writings of the
Roman poets, arising mainly from two canses : (r) they did not dis-
tinguish between the true morning rising oi a star (i. e. when it rises
at the same moment with the sun) from its apparent rising (ie. when
it rises long enough before the sun to be visible before daylight); and
(2) they occasionally (Ovid especially) copied dates from Greek
astronomical writers without correcting their calculations ior the date
or for the latitude of Rome. In the year 44 a. e. at Rome the true
morning rising of the Pleiades was on April 163 the apparent or
heliae rising was on May 28. According to the division of the seasons
in Caesada Calendar, the beginning of summer was marked by the
morning rising of the Pleiades, but whether the true or heliae rising
was meant is not stated. See W. Ramsay’s Appendix on the Roman
Calendar, Selections from Ovid, p. 3 58 sqq. ·
