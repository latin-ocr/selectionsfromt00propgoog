feet in height—which lay claim to being the Tarpeinn Rock. One
is on the north side, overlookiug the Campus Martius; the othei is
nn the south-east side, sacing the Palatino, in the garden oi the
modern German Hospital. The latter site suits history aud the
legend best,as the Roman assault was made from the side os the
Palatino and the Forum.

Through the den ran a little gurgling stream: in l. 7 and through·
out the poem it is spoken os as fons, and treated indifferentlyas a ·
stream and as a spring. Cp. sonte, fontem ll. 14, 15 with nenne l. ²4·

4. obstrepit . . . aquis. A curiously inverted expression.
The natural construction oi obstrepo is with the dative os the thing
against which the subject chases or souuds ; but here the thing chased
against is the subject, and aquis is in the ablativo: ‘The trees echo
or ring with the sound of the water? Cp. Hor. Epod. 2. αῖ

Fontesqne lymphis obstrepunt manantibus,
‘soar with their waters;' and Cic. Div. 5. 4. 1 quae res fecit nt tibi
titteris obstrepere non auderem, where both constructions are used.

6. pomae tre, ‘more usually potum ire,’ Palmer.

ll. dicuntur tura, ‘law is administered’ “

Carcer or Mamertine prison, known anciently as Tullianum. Now
the name Tullianum is derived from an old word tullius, signifying
a spring, aud in reality means ‘ Well-housess There is a well still to
be seen in the prison: it is therefore possible that the fons oi Tarpeia
