306 NOTES.

reservoir which never failed, mentioned as a marvel incorrecta
with the monument of king Alyattes by Herod. 1. 93. Towhrth
word tincta refers is not known.

19. columnas, i. e. the Pillars of Hercules, supposed to hat
been set up by him at Calpe and Abyla.

20. tarn dura, ‘in that hard hand of his.'

The next figure in Propertius’ gallery is Semiramis, the fabulas
queen of Nineveh, daughter of a Syrien goddess, and wife of nna
whose favour she won by her skill in taking Bactra. After herlus
band's death she ruled long alone; conquered many nations, inclutis
Egypt; built Babylon, with its famous walls of brick; ereaedit
Nineveh a monument to her husband a mile high; and didnrul
other marvellous things.

21. The tenus Pasiam, iliades, and Parthiam, are usedit
differently by the Augustan writers. In Od. a. 2 Horace spetlssl
the Parthians first as Persiaus‚ l. aa, and a few lines further ou!
Medes. Cp. Luc. 6. 446 Babylon Persea.

22. ut, consecutive: ‘so as to rear,' =‘ rearingj

cocto, of the brick walls of Babylon. Cp. Ov. Met. 4. 58

ubi dicz'tur altam
Coctilibus inuris cinxisse Semiramis urbem.

Paley and Pinder both suppose Propertius' meaning to be tt
these great works, carried out by women, would never have ba
achieved by their husbauds alone. There is uo indication otus
such comparison in the text. All that Propertius does is to iudiorl
instances of female greatness.

23. in adversum missi, i. e. ‘moving in opposite directions
‘meeting face to face?

24. N. and F. have nec ; others ne. If ne be read, it murth
used in a consecutive sense, so that ne=ut non. Paley pronounoe
this ‘an incorrect usage:’ so also Pinder, while Palmer presersestl
nec of N. and adopts mitti, the tempting conjecture of R. Y. Tyutl
for missi in l. 2 3. But all these editors have failed to see the tw
construction. Semiramis is the main subject of the whole passi&
down to l. 26: statuit in l. 21 being continued by Duxit, candidati
2 5, and Iussit 1. 26. The whole three lines, 22-24, are subordinat
to statuit, and ne, l. 24, is subordinate to ut l. 22. The whol
passage reads literally thus: ‘Semiramis built Babylon in sucht
way that she reared walls of brick, and that two chariots facing etti
other could not (i. e. needed not to) graze their sides in consequeus
of their axles touching.' Ille does not stand for ut nara, but onlyta
non after the preceding ut of consequence. Cp. Cic. Fin. r. 851
