With regard to the relationship of the four MSS, A. F.
V. and D., Baehrens has propounded a theory of his own,
the grounds for which, such as they are, he has explained
in his Prolegomena. He believes that the original MS. of
Propertius, which was discovered some time in the four·
teenth century and is now lost, was twice copied about the
middle of that century: one of these copies, h'e holds, is
represented by the MSS. A. and F ., of which the latter is
inferior to and later than the former. The other copy is
preserved to us in V. and D. Thus A. and F. constitute
one family of copies, D. and V. constitute another family3
and the corrections of the second hand in V. and F.
(called in this edition V². and ΡΨ.) are due to the scholars
of the fifteenth century, who corrected mistakes in some
cases by transferring readings from the one family to
the other, in others by sheer invention. He thus holds
that a judicious comparison of the readings of these
two families (excluding the corrections in V. and F.)
willenable us to reconstruct in great measure the original
archetype from which the first two copies were derived.
To this supposed archetype he gives the sign of 0., a
mode of designation which has been adopted for con·
venience sake in this edition, although, as will be seen,
with a somewhat different meaning. ·

We have now to ask, what weight is to be attached to ·
this ingenious theory? A careful examination of the re·
corded readings will showthat Baehrens is rightinclassing
A. F. as one family, and D. V. as another: but what of Ο.
and N. i It is obvious that his view of 0. must depend
upon his being able to showthat N. is a more recent, and a
less trustworthy, MS. than the four upon which he chiefly
relies: whereas Mr. Ellis, Mr. Palmer, M. Plessis-and
to a considerable extent F. Leo¹-agree in holding it to
