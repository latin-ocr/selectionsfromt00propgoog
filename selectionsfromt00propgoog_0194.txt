‘According to Homeric Geography‚ thereerth was a flat circular
plain or disc, completely encompassed and bounded by the great
stream of Ocean. The abode of departed spirits, the kingdom os
Hades, was called Erebus‚ and lay under the world inhabited by
meu; the entrance was placed on the western bank os the Ocean

stream, at a spot where the rivers Pyriphlegethon and Cocytus, the
latter of which is a branch of Styx, unite at a rock and pour their
waters into (the marsh of l) Acheron, Od. 10. 513. The natural
objects in this aether-world are shadowy representatione os those in
the world above. There is a sky, and clouds, and storms, meadows,
hills, trees, and fruits. The only thing wanting is a Sun. The

“ bright light os day never penetrates into those dismal regions, which
are overspread by a gloomy twilight. As upon earth, good and bad
men are mingled together without distinction; the former enjoy no
reward, the latter suffer no punishment. A few only who have
broken their oaths, Il. 3. 276, or openly outraged the majesty oi
heaven, are tortured as the enemies of the gods. Such are Tityus,
Tantalus, and Sisyphus. The ghosts of the dead wear the same ex·
ternal aspect as at the moment when they departed from lise, sollow
the same pursuits, and cherish the same feelings and passinus. Thus
Odysseus recognises, at once, all his former friends, as they throng
the edge of the pit, eager to drink the blood of the victims which he
had slain. He beho'lds Minos grasping a sceptre, laying down laws,

, and deciding the controversies os the dead, and Orion, club in hand,
pursuing and slaying the beasts of chase, while Ajax, still cherishing
vindictive wrath, turns away and refuses to hold communion with
his former foe.

‘On the whole, the inmates of Erebus are discontented and nn·
happy, comparing their actual nothingness with their former vigour
and power. Achilles, in reply to the compliments of Odysseus‚
exelaims,

Extol not death to mc, illustriores chief,

For rather would I toil on earth 1ίονΙιὶνε,
The bonded servant of some necdy sarain, ¹
T Itan rule supreme o’er all tlte slradowy hosts·
