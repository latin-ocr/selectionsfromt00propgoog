erronearum, rv. 6, 2³:³5· 351

ter simply indicates there were several waves or curls in the
flame; teris a mystic, and therefore poetic, number. Virgil identi-
fies this fex with the Iulium sidus.
31. attulerat, i.e. ‘appeared with:’ Postgate well compares
Cic. Phil. 8. 8. ²3·
in oolla solutos, ‘flowing in disorder on to his neck'
32. inerme, i. e. he had come as the god of battle, as ‘lord of
the unerring bow,’ and soon to be Ι

33. ‘But (he appeared) with such alook as that with which,’ etc:
i· e. quali-vultu has a double construction: it is both au ablativa of
quality attached to Apollo as he appeared at Actium, and an·
ablative of the instrument in connection with adspexit. The allusion
0f course is to the description of Apollo when he smote the Greeks
with pestileuce in his wrath against Agamemnon for refusing the
Strit of Chryses, Iliad 1. 48 seqq.
βῆ δὲ κατ’ Οὐλύμποιο καρήνων χωόμενος κῆρ,
τόξ’ ὤμοισιν ἔχων ἀμφηρεφέα τε φαρέτρην·
ἔκλαγξαν δ’ ἄρ’ ὀϊστοὶ ἐπ’ ὤμων χωομένοιο, ,
αὐτοῦ κινηθέντος· ὁ δ’ ἤϊε νυκτὶ ἐοικώς.
34. effossas. Egeeere properly ‘to carry forth,’ used here as

equivalent to efferre, asin Pers. 5. 69
ecce aliud eras

Egen't Iros annos,

‘ carries forth to burial.’ The expression, however, is confused by
making cestra th'e object instead of the bodies, whilst rogis does not
suggest of itself the funeral processioa. It is not necessary to suppose
that egerere means ‘to empty,‘ either here, or iu Stat. Theb. 1. 37
egestas alternis mortibus urbes. The literal translation is intelligible
enough: ‘carried forth (to burial), i. c. consumed‚ the Greek camp
hythe greedy funeral pyres' So in thc passage from Statius, ‘whole
cities taken out to burial by.’
35. solvit, os the muscles relaxed in death. As Postgate says
(see his note on passage), per orbes goes equally with solvit and ser-
pentem, which ishere the participle. It means ‘coil by coil,' just as
explicuit per membra virum quoted by Postgate from Luc. 4. 629
means ‘limb by limb’ Per gives the idea of successive stages.
