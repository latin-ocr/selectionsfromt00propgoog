TO PROPERTIUS. xlix

all sensibility, and that Propertius the man was something
wholly different from the Propertius disclosed to usin
his poems. It is more pleasing to suppose that the
quarrel never was healed; that Cynthia died in estrange·
ment, and that Propertius in consequence took no part in
y her funera13 but that soon afterwards a feeling oi remorse
and contrition came over him, to which he gave ex·
pression in a poem confessing his coldness, and acknow·
ledging the claims which, after all, she still possessed upon
his regard. But the poem is not the work of a heart·
broken man; and its tone affords additional confirmation
oi the view that Propertius’ muse was not at once chilled
into silence by the death of Cynthia.

As might well be supposed, Propertius counted among
his friends all, or almost all, ol the famous poets of his
time. In 3. 26. 31 he pays a noble tribute to Virgil;
Ovid, as we have seen, tells us that Propertius was his
intimate friend, and that he himself used often to hear
him recite his poenas. Ponticus, the epic poet, is ad-
dressed in 1. 7, Bassus in 1. 4, and a tragic poet, Lynceus,
is mentioned in 2. 34. But what of Horace, the period of
whose best lyrical activity so closely coincided with his
own? He is never named: yet the two must have met
on the common ground of literature, and in the house ¹
of Maecenas. They were men of very different temper: .
the easy-going well-bred and sels-controlled man of the
world may well have sneered at the morbidly sensitive
and capricious enthusiast whose key was often one
of exaggeration: and the ill-regulated impetuosity of the
Umbrian bard may have felt repelled by the serene and
critical seli-confidence of the Epicurean, whose easy man·
ners might be mistaken by the vain seli-conscious poet
for the airs of ‘a superior person! Neither poet ever
names the other: and the careful analysis made by Mr.
Postgate os Hor. Ep. 2. 87 (Introd, p. xxxiii) leads strongly
to the conclusion that that passage isan elaborate attaclr
