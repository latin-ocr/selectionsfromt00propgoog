320 noras,

tecm, i. e. ‘in your own mind and heort'

18. inpransum, with sense of motion: ‘rising to cheer,‘ Post·
gnte.

iuvent, ‘be thy delight,’ as in Hor. Od. 1. 1. 4.

19. Atreum. See note on 2. 13. 22.

supera, ‘ ontvie,’ ‘ontdo.‘

20. Gemmas, in allusion to the costly and extravagant novel·
ties of decoration in which the exhibitors of games vied with one
another in their efforts to obtain popularity. We hear of the some
of a theatre being overlaid with silver, ivory, or gold; of the arcae
being strewn with vermilion; of the cord of the podium being twined
with gold, or covered with amber ornaments, etc.

isto, contemptnous. There is no authority or excuse for reni·
ing usta.

21. This line is very unsatisfactory as it stands in the MSS.
sed tamen hoo. Tamen seems clearly to'be wrong: it is wear in
itself, and gives a quite unnecessary emphasis to sed. Hoc appetis
in all the MSS. before omnes: if the more easy huc was written by
Propertius, it is inexplicable how the more difficult reading hoc came
to be substituted for it. On this ground Professor Palmer suggests
to me that tamen was introduced in consequence of Sed, and thet
the true reading is Sed enarret hoc omnes. He quotes the Horatios
Hoc quoque te manet Epp. 1. 20. 17, and points to the following
passage from the Epicedion Drusi, a poem modelled on Propertius,
as almost decisive:

Fata monent omnes ,· omnes expectat evomes
Portitor ; ct turbae vix satis una ratis.
Tendimus lruc ornnes: metam properamus ad unam!
Omm'a sub leges mors vocat atra suos.
This passage seems to be a distinct echo of the passage Morcus
Propertius probably wrote oronet ; and tamen, which contains excedi
the same letters, got accidentally substituted for it. But Sedis
as much out of place astarten, for the poet has already declared rho
all werith, etc, will corneto naught, in the emphatic words egrabo
isto dabe'a What is needed in l. 21 is not a contrast, butan ampli·
fication of that theme: ‘all will go to the flames: but nevertheles
all ends in death,’ is a manifestly absurd connection. If we md
Hectorem, lrocomnes all is clear. The repetition of Hoc . . >loc . ··
fruc in one line was too mnch for the scribe: the corruption tamer
naturally suggested that of Hoc into Sed. The repetition How
hoc . . . huc is quite in the manner of Propertius. Cp. 4. 4. 37
Ille equus, ille meos in castra reponet aarum:
