PROPERTIUS‚ lv. 11., 49-65. 365

Increpet absumptum nec sua mater Ityn.

60. ire, scarcely, ‘fall ς’ rather ‘go forth,’ ‘have their course)

‘tiow,’ asin 3. 1. 8
Exacto pumice uersus eat,
where see note

tre ᾱοο. So Consol. Liv. 209

lacrimas elicuique deo.

61. vensis, supposed to refer to a robe of honour presented to
matrons who had borne three children: Dion. Cass. 55. a. Τὴε
phrase stolatae feminae on inscriptions has been held to refer to this
distinction.

62. leo mea. . . rapina, ‘I was not snatched.’

63. Her two sons: the elder, consul Α. 1). 1, was called L.
Aemilius Paullus ; the younger was called M. Aemilius Lepidus,
and was consul Α.1). 6. Why the cognomina of the two brothers
were different is not clear. ἲ

65. Her brother, P. Cornelius Scipio, was consul 13.c. 16, and
had therefore presumably filled two curule offices previously, the
curule aedileship and the praetorship. Tempore means ‘betimes;'
or ‘just at the right moment.’ Having seen her brother occupy
two curule offices, and finally elected to the consulship, she was
‘felix opportunitate mortis) Tempore might also mean ‘too soon3'
or again simply ‘just at that time,’ ‘ at the very moment ’(=eo ipso
tenpore), i. e. when he had been elected consul, aud before he had
actually held the office. -

Paley explains the line as ‘a brief or rather a confused way of
expressing qui eum consul foetus esset, eo tempore rupta est soror
eius, or cuius consulatus tempore rupta est soror ,·' or else with
Hertzberg would make tempore au ablative of the instrument.
Munro, Joum. of Phil. vol. 6. p. 62, declares the former view
meaningless, the latter out of place, and proposes

Consule quo, sesto tempore rapto soror.
Postgate reads laeto, which has the same meaning. But the idea of
either word is out of place here: she is narrating bare facts in this
passage, in a tone of pride, not of grief, and the pathetic reference
to her dying in a time of joy is uncalled for. Another solution is
more probable. Iwould suggest that quo is used here, by a kind
of confusion, in a double construction, to be taken boile with consule
and with tmepore: ‘At which time, just as he had been made con-
sul, his sister was carried off,' or ‘ Who having been made consul
just at that time, his sister was carried off? Horace is extremely
fond of placing words in positious where they are mesu& ’sobe
