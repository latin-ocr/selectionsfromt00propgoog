TIBULLUS, I. 7., 49. 147

‘The Genius was naturally believed to exercise an especial auper-
inteudence over wedlock; the marriage bed was under his protection,
and was called genialis tmes¹‚ and the expression genialis praeda
is appropriately applied by Ovid A. A. 1. 12 5 tc the Sabine women,
whom the Romans had forcibly seized for their brides. Observc
also that genialis is used generally as an epithet for anything which
conduces to festivity, mirth‚ or pleasure. Genialis dies is a day of
joviality, Genialr's hiems points out winter as the season of convi-
viality, expressions arising from the comfortable doctrine held by the
ancients, that in taking care ol themselves, and loolring aster their
own enjoyments, they were performing an acceptable service to their
Genius. Those who practised abstineuce were said defraudare
Genium suune, Terent. Phorm. 1. 1. 9 bellaperare curn Genio²;
while the precept of Persius, S.5. 151 indulge Genio, isan exhor-
tation to eat, drink, and be merry. Iu like manner, as there were
public Lares and Penates, the whole Roman people, taken collectively,
'was supposed to have a Genius. When we read in Livy 21. 62 thet
the Genius was propitiated by the sacrifice of five full-grown victims,
we must understand the historiau to mean the Public Genius, to whom
we find votive tablets inscribed with the words GEN 10. P. R We
find similar tablets to the Genius of an Army, of a Century, of a
Colony; nay more, places also had their Genius⁸, aud Prudentius, .
C. Symm. 2. 369, 444, twits his opponent with the lact, that walls,
gates, baths‚ stables, all had their Genii, so that scarce a comer cf
the city could bc found without a god os its own. The Genius of a
place was represented by a snake, Servius, Virg. Aen. 5. 85; and
hence to paint a snake upon the walls cl any place of public resort
was the method adopted to point out that it was sacred, and not to
be defiled, Pers. S. 1. 113.

‘Somewhat more mystical is the statement of Aufustius, an nn·
known writer quoted by Festus ⁴, that the Genius is the son ol the
gods, and the creatorot' men (deornmfilins et parens hominum), the
instrument, as it were, employed by the gods in the formation of meu.
