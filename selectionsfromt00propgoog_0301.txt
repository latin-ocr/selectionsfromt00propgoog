crowning triumph of Augustus’ foreign policy; and it was deened
so essentia} to his position as sole ruler of Rome that he should
obtain a great success over the Parthians, that it is not only pcr-
petually celebrated in terms of triumph by the court poets aderitum
obtained, hut it is frequently referred to in anticipation. Thustlu
mere mention of a Parthian victory is by no means sufficieutia
itself to prove that the passage in which it occurs was written aller
rac. 20. The famous lines in Virg. Geo. 3. 30 sqq„ iu which
the Anneniaa and Parthian successes of Augustus seem tote
allneletl to, were in all probability written in a tone of propheat
for l'irgil died in u. c. 19, and the Georgica were written at least tu
years before the events supposed to be referred to occurred. Te
same explanation is to be given with regard to Hor.0d.2.1u
18-20, where Parthian successes are spoken of in un Ode which hou
other causes can scarcely be dated later than Β, c. 23.
ln the magnificent statue of Augustus, which now adorus ue
Braccio N novo in the l'atican, and which was dug up in thevilla
Livia at the Sacra Rubra (now Patarea Parta) in 1863, the cuirassit

Roman imagination. Their chief arm was a light cavalry, who
were arnrcd with bows and shot from horseback. They werein
fact a specics of mounted infantry, pecnliarly adapted to a dean
country where the great heat, the want of water and supplies, he
long distances and the buming sand, rendered the Roman system ol
fighting practically impossible. Thus virg. Geo. 3. 31

bttleatanqua suga Parthum, versisque sagittis.

Cp. Ilor. Od. 2. 13. 173 in Sata. 1.15,in a passage exactlyparslltl
to this, he declares it is not every poet that causing of wars,

Atat lahcattis equa desm'hat atelnera Parthi.
Cp. Persius 5. 4
l'ulncra scu Parthi flaccentis ah inguine ferrum.
So again, Prop. 3. 9. 54 describes the Parthian flying shots as
Parthorum astutae tela remissa fugae.

R. Ellis, Phil. Journ. xv. p. 14, objects to the usual rendering
of this passage, as not giving the natural meaning of the words.
Hc thinks that the expression is obviously taken from un army 0r
