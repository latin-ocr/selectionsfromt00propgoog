erronearum, 11.13., 34-55. 247

Ι 42. ad verum eapte, ‘has some sense towards, in the direc-
ζ tion of, truth?

' conscie, is simply ‘conscious,' ‘sentientz’ here the spirit is not
only conscious, but ad venem sapei, i. e. can form true ideas.

· 43. prumia cunis, ‘the cradle that ushers in life ;’ exactly
like extremus in 3. n. ιι

Martis ab extrema condicione vacant.

ponere, to lay down give up

47. The S. Shave Quis tam longaevae, which rs clearly
corrupt. Hertz has Cae se longaevae the correctron Cur se tam lon-
gae seems best. Cui' se written m oue word would become quis, and
then longae would be lengthened into longaevae for the mette.

48. The first word is quite uncertain: the two first letters were
probably lost iu the archetype, as Palmer suggests. carneus is a
very unnatural word to use of a Phrygian in reference to the Homeric
period: Ilius (Lachmann) would give a harsh jingle: and bellicus
(Palmer) is tame. Postgate justly thinks that a proper name is
required; and would defend Gallicus as referring ιο Hector, the Θ pp
Γάλλος being a river in Phrygia (Herodian 1. 11. ι), with which
Hector may have been connected iu some legend. If Memnon
be referred to, who killed Antilochus while defending his father, he
thinks the passage corrupt.

49. This passage was evidently in Juvenal's mind when he
wrote Sat. ιο. 246-255.

51. debis, a gentle request‚ as above, ll. 27, ²9·

53. qul, the MS. reading, has been needlessly altered to cni.
Palmer well quotes Ov. Her. 20.103: the word testis does not imply
that ‘a boar was a witness ιο a moral ιιιιιιι’ (Paley)‚ any more than
Hor. Od. 3. 4. 69

Τιιιιί mearum centimanus Gyas

opinions. Testis simply means ⁸ affords proof or evidence of?
