PROPERTJUS,1v. 6., 3⁶42. 353

minantis as au accusative after vehunt, agreeing with some substantive
understood (⁶ forms threatening with (i) Centaurs’ rocks‚' Postgate,
or‘figures threatening to hurl giant stones,' Pinder), is very awkward.
With Centauros all is plain: ‘and as to their prows carrying Cen·
taus which hurl stones.’ The expression is confused, referring both
to the Centaurs, which were often put as figure-heads, and to the
hugo catapults for hurling stones, with which Dion. 50. 33 tells us
Antony’s ships were fitted. Propertius may have thought the two
verecombined.

50. viana, referring to the timber frames put round some of
the vessels, either to protect them from being rammed, orto assist in
b0arding the enemy. These timbers would be found to offer no
resistance (caua), and the engines to be mere painted bogeys.

51. in, as so frequently, ‘in the case of.’ See a. 10. 21 and

temporis auctor, because Apollo has suggested the moment
for joining battle. It must be confessed that Apollo’s speech is
aomewhat prosy: its trite phrases suggest the idea of its having been
written to order.

55. pondua, ‘its contents ' or ‘freight’

57. ude, for ‘Phoebus was true to his word and true to the
cause which he protected.' Postgate.

58. sceptra macta vehuntur, a powerful metaphor: the
ensigns of Antony and Cleopatra’s royal power drift shattered and

helpless upon the waters.
59. Idalio, in allusion to Caesar’s descent from Venus, to

whom Mount Idalium in Cypros was sacred.
astro, the comet or meteor into which Caesar's soul was popu-

larly believed to have passed, Suet. Jul. 88.
60. Α very dull and egotistical remark to escape from the

deified Julius on such an occasion. His style had not improved.
ista fides, i. e. ‘this exploit of yours (isto) proves you to be of

my own truc blood.¹
62. libera signa, ‘the standards of freedom,' Postgate ; but his

examples do not appear to meto justify the translation. Our English
