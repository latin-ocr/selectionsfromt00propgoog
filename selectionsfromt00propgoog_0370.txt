PROPERTIUS, 111. 7., ⁶5·7²; 111. 11.‚1-2. 303

buckle on her armonr, Prop. 4. 6. 22. Even Horace has not escaped
'arom the difficulty: were the Egyptian queen so corrupt, so effem-
inate and luxurious, where was the great glory of overcoming her?
*Antony's great ability could not be recognised: for the cue given ’
²out both by Caesar and Augustus was that Romans had neker
¹-triumphed over Romans. Propertius solves the difficulty in his own
vray. He exalts the victory os Augustus by exalting first the genius
of woman, and by pointing to the master-minds amongst women
who had showed great masculine powers, and exerted empire over
men. The character os Cleopatra is not spared; she is painted in the
vilest colours; but there is the sense all through that she was agreat
woman, that she had been strong enough to conceive direct hopes os
=2dding Rome to her domain, and that she had all but suceeeded in
her ambition. He makes us feel that there was indeed cause sor trem·
bling at Rome during the time when, as Horace puts it Od. 1.,37. 6-8
Capitolio
Regina dementes ruinas
Funus et inperio parabat.

All this is naturally introduced, as from the poet’s own experiences :
he begins simply, in his usual strain, justilying his devotion to Cyn·
thia: his enslavement to her (cp. l. a addictum sub rua iura virum
to Horace’s eiriamipatus feminae) is typified and justified by the en·
slavement os men to Medea, to Omphale, to Semiramis, and the all-but
enslavement of the Roman world to Cleopatra. The subject grows
naturally out os his own life and feeling: aud the panegyric ou
Augustus is thus introduced more naturally, and with sar more power,
than in the more elaborate and official description of Actium in 4. 6.

1. vereat. The frequentative form of the verb makes it appro-
priate for expressing violence and passion. Thus in Virg. Aen. 7.
336 Juno declares that Alecto the Fury has power odiis versare
domm (⁴to overtum,’ Mackail, but it is rather equivalent to turbare).
Cp. Liv. a. 45. 5 nunc pudor nunc indignatio versare pectora ;
Pto .3. 17. 12 .

p Spesque timorque animum versat utroque toro.

meam vitam. A Propertian periphrase sor mc.

2. addietum, ‘made over! Addicerc is said ol the judge who
formally makes over any thing or person to a claimant. Addictus
is thus specially used of a debtor handed over as bondsman to his
creditor. Horace has the same idea in a similar connection of Anto·
nius, Emancipatus feminae Epod. 9.12. So of himself 'as a free
lance in philosophy, Epp. 1. 1. 14

Nullius addictus iurare in acrba magistri. Ι
