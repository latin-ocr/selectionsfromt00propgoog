Icelus is the funeral bier, often richly ornameuted, ou which tle
body was carried to budal.

Anauon. either ‘ sumptuous,’ from the wealth of the ΗΜ
Pergamus, as in Hor. Od. 1. 1 Attalico} condicionibus5 or, atna-
gate suggests. ‘ embroidere'd with gold,' an art which Plin. Η
s. 48 attributes to the lust Attalus. Cp. Attalicas vestes 3. thro
ln 2. 32. 12 the handsome hangtngr in the Porticus Pomona
called terefora Attalica.

Exactly similar are the expressions nostrae m'tae, 1. 2. 31, ‘touch

genitive, ‘let no chargers be anayed,' i. e. ‘let there be uo aruytl

books form a modest complete number; less than three wouldbe
meagre‚ either for a poet or a processiou; three was the nunbfl
