It we keep sed we may explain it as either (ι) 111 reference to ornnes .·
‘why spealr of the rich? Death awaits all, rich and poor alike ;’
or (a) as a repetition and enforcement os the idea contained in
ignibus or dabis : ‘you may have all wealth, but all will go to the
flames, but all alike end in death! Hoc has been changed to leuc
in consequence oi the huc later in the line, otherwise 'a verb of rest
(agimus or facimus) would have to be supplied with hoc, a verb of
motion with huc, the awkwardness 01 which was intolerable. The
repetition 01 sed, 1. 22, is another argument against sedin 1. 21.

primus at artimus ordo, in allusion to the well-known four·
tren front rows reserved 101 equites by the law 01 Otho.

22. mala, a strong word, expressing abhorrence. Mala sit is
rsregular form 01 curse, and we may almost translate here ‘ac-
cursed!

24, publica. There is no distinction 01 rank or classes among
Charon's passengers: the primus et ultimus ordo, the ‘classes' and
the ‘masses,' all huddle together.

25. 1110. He passes from Marcellus and the person whom he
has been addressing, ll. 17-54, to the representative of man in
general. Perhaps ille may bear the sense of ‘your famous captain’
[Pinder).

, ferro refers probably to the coat of mail, greaves‚ etc.; aare to
the helmet. ’

26. protrahit, i. e. drags him out of his protecting armour, as
though he had secured himself in a sortress.

eaput, by the series of steps illustrated on 2. 1. 36, comesto mean
as here ‘the body’ rather than ‘the life' (Postgate), which is too
abstract an idea sor this passage.

With these lines cp. Dunbar, Lament 101 the Makkaris:
