preparemur, 1v.4.,15-41. 343

30. non pauenda The poet glauces at her future punishment.

31. Paley says the speech os Tarpeia cannot extend to 1. 66,
because flevit is inappropriate to the passage from l. 48. But it is
clear the whole is spoken by Tarpeia She begins ll. 31-46 by a
soliloquy: she theu, ll. 47-66, goes on as is she were addressing
Tatius, and discloses to him her plan.

34„ Dum . . . conspicer, ‘Provided only I may gaze on.'

35. montibu· addita noma. Addita is used here in a
pregnant sense, to give the idea that Rome was something iar greater
· than the site on which she stood. So in a bad sense, ‘inflicted upon,'

T eucn’s addita Iuno Virg. Aen. 6. 90 and Luc. ap. Maer. 5. 6. 4
Si mihi non praetor siet additus atque agitet me.
Paley feebly explains ⁸ the buildings add to the height oi the montes!

36. valeat, ‘Farewell to.’ She here meditates merely running
away: the idea of eamiug her right to be Tatius' wife by treachery
has not yet suggested itself.

pudenda, not in its usual sense, ‘whom I ought to be ashamed
οἷ’ (Pal), but ‘before whom I ought to feel shame.’

37, 38. Her mind reverts to the dazzliug apparition of Tatius
on his horse: a confirmation offrena in l. 20.

37. meon umores is generally held to refer to Tarpeia herself,
‘my loving seli,' just as in 2. 13. 22 mors mea=ego mortuus, and in
3. 5. 4nostra sitis=ego sitiens. But Palmer is doubtless right in
supposing it refers to Tatius: ‘my love,' ‘ my darling.’ So in 2. 28. 39,
of C thia

yn Una ratis fati nostros portabit amores.

Tarpeia is recalling in a hopeless dreamy way the vision of Tatius
on horsebacke she envies the horse his privilege os carrying his rider
back to the camp ;' and then recounts with a half-approval instances
ol maidens who have been urged to bold wicked deeds by the urgency
oi their passion. It would be quite out os place for her, at this stage,
to contemplate calmly a successful elopement.

39, 40. Like Virgil, E. 6. 74, and Ovid, Fast. 4. 500, Pro·
pertius consounds Scylla the daughter of Nisus, king os Megara,
with the sea-monster of Homer and later tradition, who lived on
the Italian side of the Straits of Messiua. The former betrayed ‘her
father and her country to Minos, king of Crete, by cutting off a cer·
‚tain purple loek other father‘s hair. See Aesch. Cho. 615, Pausan.
Att. 1. 19. 5 ' (Paley). Thus Prop. 3. 19. 21

Teque o Mirm venumdata, Scylla, figura,
