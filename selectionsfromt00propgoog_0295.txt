NOTES.

II. 3.

The poet cnlarges on the charms of Cynthia, which jutitytti
absorbing character of his passion.

1. nocere, of the harm, damage, or ‘wounding’ canali!
love. Postgate defends the MS. reading nullum.

2. spiritua, ie. the poet's boasting that he had eastimet
clear of his love, and was a free man once more. For spirito
‘breath,’ in the sense of pride and boasting, ep. Hor. Sat. 2. 3. 3¹¹

Corpore maiorem rides Turbonis in arinis
Spiritum et incessum.
The similar use in the Scottish dialect of the word ‘wind' isal
illustrated in the Litany ascribed to the anceetor of the prestat
Mr. Maxtone-Graham of Cultoquhey. Laird of a small propelli·
surrounded hy four great families, he daily prayed at ‘the wuhhr
well' of the domain:

From tle craft ostie Campbells,
From tlte pride os tlte Grpemcs,
From the ire of the Drummonds,
From tlte wind ostie Morays‚
Good Lord, dcliver us.

4. tiber alter. These words are generally referred to ue
publication of the F irst book of the Elegiae, as though within ont
month the poet began the writing of the Second (see nundi·
But the reference might be merely to a temporary abjurementol
Cynthia—perhaps the same as that referred to in 2. a. 1 Liber aaa,
etc-and the liber might only be a maxima historia, or one of the
longas Iliadas which the beauty of Cynthia was perpetually forcing
from him, a. 1. 16, 14.

5. quaerebam-11, ‘I was casting about to see if,' ‘I was
trying to discover whether;' and then follow two impossibilities to
show the futility of the attempt to give up his love.

6. brec solitus is here equivalent to vel ri non solitus or inco
litus, as is evident from a comparison of si posset l. 5 with si possem
l. 7. The use of necas equivalent to et non is frequentin caseswherr
the negative qualifies the whole sentence which follows. But here

Propertius uses nec in such a way that its negative only qualifies the
single word solitus. So in a. 28. 52

Vobiscum Europe nec proba Pasiphae,
nec proba is equivalcnt to et non proba or et improba. similarly
