312 ' NOTES.

50. aarum is the dative, going with precare diem. But the
conjunction of the name with salva is intended to indicate that
Augustus was the saviour.

51. ermini. The Nile shrinks now in terror before Augustus,
in contrast to the threats which it uttered before his victory, l. 4²·

vage, as already noted, is used frequently in a bad sense. ll ³
may refer here to the many mouths of the Nile, or to its inundation, '
when it spreads over country not its own. Vagus has frequently
the sense ol irregular action, beyond a thing's proper sphere. Thus

, it is used of a mast unstepped (Cat), of a foot in too big a shte

(Hor), of the Tiber beyond his banks‚ Hor. Od. 1. 2. 18.

53. Brachia spectavit. Propertius does not observe the usual
rule of Latin prosody, which does not tolerate a short final syllable
before words beginning with sc, sp, st, sq. Thus he has beni span· ,
debant 4. 1. 41 ; consuluitque strages 4. 5. 17.

spectavit, read by Per„ seems here to be the true reading.
Spectavi cannot be satisfactorily explained. It could only refer to
seeing in imagination, or to some representation of Cleopatra.
Possibly‚ as Pinder suggests, that carried in Augustus' triumph.

54. soporis tter, like martis iter 3. 7. 2 andformnae auximus
viasid. 3²·

trahere is difficult. 1t seems to mean ‘saw her limbs dragging
along the secret path of death' In that case trahere iter would be
like rapere, vorare, viam, etc.. but denotingslaea and painful progress.

55. hoc . . ,tanto . . . cive, ablative absolute, or ablative of
circumstance. ‘So longas thou possessedst so great a citizen as he)

aive. Augustus specially studied to be civilis in his behaviour,
and his civile ingenium was especially contrasted with the reserve
and hauteur of Tiberius.

56. et . . . lingua, ‘nor yet that tongue,' i. e. Antony. Horace
speaks of Cleopatra's excesses Od. 1. 37. 14

Mentemque lymphatam Mareotica.

57. toto. N. has tata here, and is probably right. There is
strong evidence that Propertius used the archaic declension of uirus,
totas, niellus, etc. Nullae carae occurs 1. 20. 35 in the dative,
and aizo in 2. 1. 47. It is to he noted that we often find analogies
for Propertius’ archaic nsages in Plautus, who was, as Professor
Palmer reminds me, Propertius' fellow-countryman.

58. timuit territa, pleonastic.

Marte, ‘in war.’ ,

59. Here follows a list of famous Roman exploits introduced
for the purpose of declaring that they are all thrown into the shade

hy Augustus’ victory at Actium.
