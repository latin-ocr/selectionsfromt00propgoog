1. mous, in the Propontis, or. Sea of Marmora,was original
an island. Strabo speaks of its being connected with the mainlu
by two bridges: aud Plin. N. H. 5. 40. 2 says it was joined tot
mainland by Alexander. At the present day, the connection
formed by a low narrow sandy isthmus about a mile long.

2. surr athmon, therefore, probably refers to the unsubstant
character of the connection : ‘where floats our Isthmus) Pinderthir
the words may perhaps stand for aqna Isthmus praefluit, as ill
Isthmus could be said ‘to flow with the waters’ that pass it· T
seems farfetehed. But it is just possible that Propertius uses Isthn
to denote the channel which divided the island or peninsula fromt
shore, in which easefluit would be quite regular. See below za:

8. A much-vexed line. The MSS. read Dindymus and inan
(inventu N.), whilst Cybele is variously written. Vossius cl
Jectures inuemn, which is supported on the ground mat ao
frequently appears on the coins of Cyzicus. From the similarit
existing between Cybele, Isis, Io (who gave her name to the adju
ing Bosphorus), it is supposed that Cybele may have been w
shipped at Cyzicus under the form of a cow. There was a Mn
Dindymon, or Dindyma, at Cyzicus (Strabo 12. 8. 11) of the sa
name as the more famous mountain near Pessinus, the chief seat
Cybele's worship in Phrygia, from which she derived the na
Dindymene Hor. Od. 1.16. 5. If we read Dindymus, the mo
tain itself will be intended; the construction must be either ς
Dindymus esi, or else placuit must be supplied from l. 1. Eil
construction is harsh; whence Palmer reads Dindymis, a sim
epithet to Hornee's Dindymene. Dindymis, however, might 2
stand for the town, as we leam srom Plin. N. H. 5. 40. 2, who r
that Cyzicus was also called Dindymis, cuins a vertice mons Dia
mus. He further adopts what he terms the palmaris emendati<
Haupt, sacra sabri'caia e viic C yben, on the strength of two passa,
Apoll. Rhod. 1. 1117 and Strabo 12. 8.11. Strabo speaks ‹
temple of Cybele on Mount Dindymon above Cyzicus, founded
the Argonants3 and Apollonius describes how Argus made a sti
of the goddess out of an old vine-stock, and set it upon a hill.

If Cybelae be read, it must be the dative, in honour of the g
dess.

4. The tradition that Proserpine was carried off by Pluto a
near Cyzicus is only known from this passage, and supported l
single line quoted by Hertz. frorn the Latin Anthology.

qua. So the MSS.; but with that reading the interpositior
l. 3 between the qna of 1. 2 and that of l. 4 is very harsh. Itis
