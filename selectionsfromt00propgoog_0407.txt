us are exactly parallel to 10. 1, 2. For the legend oi Tarpeia see
Liv. 1. 11,0v.Fast.1.261 sqq. The accountnow generally acceptedis
that there was originally a Latin settlement on the Palatine hille
Sabine (t) settleineut on the Quirinal and Capitol, and that the iamt
Rome was sormed by the union of the two. Roman pride could not
admit that the Capitol was not originally Roman, and so represented
it as having been lost by treachery. See Tac. Ann. 12. ²4·

2. nmina Iovis, not the threshold of the temple of suppetet
Optimus Maximus, but the approach to the Capitoline hill itsell
the whole of which was considered to have been the abode of the
god from the earliest times. Thus Virg. Aen. 8. 347, when Evander
conducts Aeneas,

Hinc ad Tarpeiam sedem et Capitolio ducit,
Virgil adds,
Iam tum religio pavidos terrebat agrestes
Dira loci, iam'tuue siloam saeuusque tremebant. ,
Evander goes on to explain that it is uncertain who the god is, bd
that his Arcadians believe they have seen Jupiter himself. So soit

8. 1. 4. Propertius means that the approach to the Capitol w?
through a rocky thickly-wooded den or gorge, the rocks (antrb

and exaggerated, but it is vain to look sor real topographicaae
Ι accuracy in the poets, or indeed the historiens, of Rome. Thffi
Roman historians are notoriously inexact and vague in sucl5
matters. Livy never helps us in his descriptions of ground, even a&
to great battle-fields which he might easily have visited. And ever!
the careful Greek Polybius, who laboriously went over the scenes of
the campaigns which he narrates, never describes a locality with the·
point and precision which are necessary for identification. The
Capitol has been so overlaid with buildings and ruins that it is im·
possible now to make out its original natural features: but there are
still two pieces oi abrupt volcanic cliii-one of them at least sixty
