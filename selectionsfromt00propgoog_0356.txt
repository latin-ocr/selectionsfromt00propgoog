ἰξοῦοῦ a sense, in a proper connection: butt to address Money with

’ζ’ΞΤῦο seeds of care take their rese from your fetentem-lead would be

3³2 little too harsh even for Propertius. Postgate supports this inter·

pretation byfhntis caput from 3.19.6; but the whole line reads
Flammaque adfantes sint reditura caput,

‘which is a perfectly natural expression, involving no harshness or
‘fmnfusion

-Ξ, decapite tuo= -de te: see above noeona 1. 36.

ΞΞ 5. undantem in this phrase has the sense os stretchingss not
of direction. The. phrase rs equivalent to in inll sail,’ implying a

Σ terque quaterque. A hyperbolical way of expressing the

:s 0 milti felicem terque quaterque diem!
ι’8ο felices ter et amplius Ηοι Od. 1. 3.17and lis terque mutatae

ll 7. exorsis has no special reference to shipwreck. The word

ql simply means ‘to fall out os :’ as when Cicero says verbum tibi nen
fortuito excidit Phil. ιο. a, ‘did not escape you;’ or os sorgetfnlness‚

· at mihi ista exciderant, ‘had escaped my memory,’Leg. 2. 18. 46.

tl Here Paetus is said to have ‘fallen out οἷ’ that which he lost or

tf from which he disappeared‚viz.his life. So above 3. 2. ²5 nonzen

ι”ῑ The juxtaposition oi neve to 'longinquis doubles the force of the

t idea, each side of the relation being stated separately. The fishes

, Ηοι. Epod. 1. 21 ut adsit. . . praesentibus, Plant. Most. 1. 1. ιι
